Depth of coverage is very high. The authors use their many years of teaching to present food engineering concepts in a logical progression that covers the standard course curriculum. Both are specialists in engineering and world-renowned. Chapters describe the application of a particular principle followed by the quantitative relationships that define the related processes, solved examples and problems to test understanding. \r\n\r\nNew chapters on:\r\n-Supplemental processes including filtration, sedimentation, centrifugation, and mixing\r\n-Extrusion processes for foods\r\n-Packaging concepts and shelf life of foods\r\nExpanded information on\r\nEmerging technologies, such as high pressure and pulsed electric field\r\nTransport of granular foods and powders\r\nProcess controls and measurements\r\nDesign of plate heat exchangers\r\nImpact of fouling in heat transfer processes\r\nUse of dimensional analysis in understanding physical phenomena","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4720b7622dd978c3e328520c54676b2b61486e0e","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Food+Engineering+4th+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4720b7622dd978c3e328520c54676b2b61486e0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,32,183,98,45,217,120,195,227,40,82,12,84,103,107,43,97,72,110,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
