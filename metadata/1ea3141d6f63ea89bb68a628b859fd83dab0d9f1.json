If the philosopher Martin Buber was right, that â€œall journeys have secret destinations of which the traveler is unaware,â€ then Burhenn is a proprietor of known unknowns. Lovers Know, her latest LP performing as The Mynabirds, was recorded in Los Angeles, Joshua Tree National Park, Nashville and Auckland, New Zealand. Before making this record, she left her home base of Washington, toured with The Postal Service, traveled alone to South Africa and then the U.K. to play her first solo shows in those places, and, upon returning stateside, made her new home in California. No song on Lovers Know is obviously the product of one place over another, but the entire record is shot through with sonic wanderlust. This is clearly a record with â€¦a restless explorerâ€™s heart.\r\n\r\nThe Mynabirds has always produced multifaceted, intricate indie pop songs, usually centered around Burhennâ€™s rich, throaty voice and her keyboard, played sometimes for fizzy fun and sometimes for poignant melancholy. Lovers Know is certainly both multi-faceted and intricate, but itâ€™s also writ larger than anything else Burhenn has done with The Mynabirds. It relies heavily on a Casio keyboard (not exactly the one she used to play NPRâ€™s South X Lullaby, but close), which lends an â€™80s ballad throwback feel to â€œAll My Heartâ€ and â€œWildfire,â€ tech-savvy, futuristic soundscapes to â€œBelieverâ€ and â€œSay Something,â€ and a little of both to â€œSemanticsâ€ and the distinctly Sega-adjacent â€œShake Your Head Yes.â€ Burhennâ€™s voice sounds well-traveled, due in part to her low vocal range and her restrained, deliberate delivery, but never crosses over into world-weariness. Lovers Know sounds like a collection of jewels, bright and eclectic, collected from points near and far, and Burhenn sounds like a wanderer who knows exactly where sheâ€™s going.\r\nRating 8.0/10\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01-the_mynabirds-all_my_heart.flac\r\n02-the_mynabirds-believer.flac\r\n03-the_mynabirds-semantics.flac\r\n04-the_mynabirds-say_something.flac\r\n05-the_mynabirds-orion.flac\r\n06-the_mynabirds-velveteen.flac\r\n07-the_mynabirds-shake_your_head_yes.flac\r\n08-the_mynabirds-wildfire.flac\r\n09-the_mynabirds-omaha.flac\r\n10-the_mynabirds-one_foot.flac\r\n11-the_mynabirds-hanged_man.flac\r\n12-the_mynabirds-last_time.flac\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCountry: USA\r\nGenre: Indie-Folk\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~812-960 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ea3141d6f63ea89bb68a628b859fd83dab0d9f1","amp;dn":"%282015%29+The+Mynabirds+-+Lovers+Know+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ea3141d6f63ea89bb68a628b859fd83dab0d9f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,163,20,29,111,99,234,137,187,104,166,40,184,89,253,131,218,176,217,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
