As an expedition photographer aboard small ships in the Arctic and Antarctic, she has chronicled the accelerating effects of global warming on the jagged face of nearly fifty thousand icebergs. Seaman's unique perspective of the landscape is entwined with her Native American upbringing: she sees no two icebergs as alike; each responds to its environment uniquely, almost as if they were living beings. Through Seaman's lens, each towering chunk of iceâ€”breathtakingly beautiful in layers of smoky gray and turquoise blueâ€”takes on a distinct personality, giving her work the feel of majestic portraiture. Melting Away collects seventy-five of Seaman's most captivating photographs, lifeaffirming images that reveal not only what we have already lost, but more importantly what we still have that is worth fighting to save","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84d6a1245eb0b26c3a3b33291fcc490b84f52c47","amp;dn":"Melting+Away+%282014%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84d6a1245eb0b26c3a3b33291fcc490b84f52c47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,214,161,36,94,176,178,108,58,59,51,41,31,204,73,11,132,245,44,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
