Acorn presents a fluid new interface that will be \nfamiliar to users of Apple's iLife applications. Designed \nfor simple editing, Acorn features flood fill, gradients, \nvector shapes, drawing and erasing tools, and more. It \nalso brings a few new tricks to the table, including \nchaining filters and easy image and canvas resizing. \nFrom quickly adding text to an image to creating a new \ngraphic with pixel-precise control to just sketching out \nideas, Acorn is great for all kinds of image editing.\n\nWhat's New?\n--&gt; Fixed a couple of crashers when opening a PSD files.\n--&gt; Fixed bug where you couldn't set the height of an \nimage via AppleScript.\n--&gt; New pref to ignore trackpad gestures (rotate, swipe \nto undo, magnify).\n--&gt; Fixed a crasher when using certain core image \nfilters.\n--&gt; You can now see the bounds when creating a new \nshape.\n--&gt; The layer list contextual menu now has the option to \nlock the clicked on layer.\n--&gt; Fixed some drawing issues with the grid when \nzoomed in.\n--&gt; Fixed a bug where the flipped cursor coordinates \nwere off by 1pt in the y direction.\n--&gt; Updated selection cursors.\n--&gt; Hold down the option key on an anchor point for a \nbezier curve to reset it. Hold down option when using a \ncontrol point, to no longer mirror it with the control \npoint opposite it.\n--&gt; New menu item to take a layered screenshot under \nthe Image menu.\n--&gt; The combo slider widgets now fit in with the rest of \nthe Acorn UI, and round down it's values when slidering.\n--&gt; The layer list thumbnail for shape layers draws a bit \nnicer now.\n--&gt; Bezier Shapes, in the shape palette (shortcut key 'p'). \nNot available in Acorn Free.\n--&gt; Newer, faster, better, stronger flood fill \nimplementation.\n--&gt; You can now lock layers (currently using the Layer &gt; \nLock Layer menu item) A UI is coming eventually for the \nlayers list.\n--&gt; No longer removing the color profile for PNG web \nexports.\n--&gt; The tooltip hint you get when you are inside a \nselection now hides when you have the shift or option \nkey down, so you can see what you want to select (or \ndeselect) better.\n--&gt; New advanced prefs pane, with fancy 'advanced' \nstuff.\n--&gt; The custom checkboxes now draw a highlight when \nthey have focus.\n--&gt; You can now tab between the size and opacity fields \nin the brush palette.\n--&gt; Updated UI for the canvas free rotate, and you can \nnow use your mouse to rotate the canvas when in this \nmode.\n--&gt; Updated UI on the scale transform.\n--&gt; Fixed a problem where sometimes clicking on a text \narea would reset it's color to black.\n--&gt; You can now save and open files as Microsoft Icons \n(.ico).\n--&gt; Double clicking on a rectangle will now open up the \nframe tab in the shape attributes palette.\n--&gt; Fixed a bug where paragraph styles were not scaled \nin text boxes along with the rest of the image.\n--&gt; Fixed a bug where &quot;New Layer With Selection Via \nCut&quot; with shape layers didn't work properly.\n--&gt; An additional Transform operation &quot;Scale Transform&quot; \nhas been added, bringing the total up to 3. They've also \nbeen moved under a new Layer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â¸ Transform menu, and \nthe Scale Transform now uses the cmd-shift-t shortcut, \nsince this is the most common type of transform that \nfolks are trying to do.\n--&gt; Select All now works while you are cropping, and \nsets the crop to the whole canvas.\n--&gt; A new &quot;precision mode&quot; button for the brush tool, \nwhich lets you make your brush strokes in \nslllllooooooowwwwww mooooooootttttttiiiiiooonnnn.\n--&gt; Updated to a version of SQLite with better file \nlocking behavior, which means you can now save Acorn \ndocuments on AFP volumes.\n--&gt; Acorn does a better job at keeping the cursor \nhidden when drawing in slowmo mode.\n--&gt; Fixed a bug where duplicating a shape layer would \nforget corner radiuses on rectangle shapes.\n--&gt; You can now change the bounds of a selected shape \nfrom the tools palette.\n--&gt; Fixed a bug where new image from clipboard would \nallow you to undo a change that you didn't make.\n--&gt; The Python runtime is no longer loaded into Acorn if \nyou don't have any plugins installed which can use it.\nThis cuts down on memory that Acorn uses.\n--&gt; If your bitmap layers have a frame that falls outside \nthe canvas bounds, then you'll see a light gray line \nrepresenting those bounds as seen in this movie.\n--&gt; Three finger swipes on your macbook's trackpad \nnow performs an undo for left swipes, redo for right \nswipes, select next layer for up swipes, and select \nprevious layer for down swipes. (This is only for \nmacbooks which have support for gestures in the \ntrackpad).\n--&gt; You can now use pinch motions on the trackpad to \nzoom in and out, or rotate the canvas (for macbooks \nwhich have support for it).\n--&gt; The Canvas Resize command no longer brings up a \nmodal window, and instead puts it's UI in a sheet.\n--&gt; You are now given an option to resize the canvas or \nnot on rotate, as well as showing a grid.\n--&gt; You can now use the arrow keys to rotate the \ncanvas, when the Image ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â¸ Rotate Canvas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â¸ Free Rotate \ncommand is being used.\n--&gt; Shape handles are now drawn outside the canvas \nwhen the frame of the graphic are outside.\n\nInstallation:\n--&gt; Unzip &amp; mount dmg\n--&gt; Drag app to your applications folder\n--&gt; Follow instructions in .txt file to register program\n--&gt; Done!\n\nENJOY!! \n--&gt; IsolatedSoul5591","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a584aab62e649baa378592de429f76fb056987f3","amp;dn":"Acorn+v2.2+%5BIsolatedSoul5591%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a584aab62e649baa378592de429f76fb056987f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,132,170,182,46,100,155,170,55,133,146,222,66,159,118,251,5,105,135,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
