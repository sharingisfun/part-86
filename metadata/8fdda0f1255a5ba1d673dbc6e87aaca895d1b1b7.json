Enchanted, he follows it on horseback, waving his arms like a bird.\n\nTen years later, Lieutenant Richthofen is serving as a fighter pilot with the Imperial German Air Service along the Western Front. After dropping a wreath over the funeral of an Allied pilot, Richthofen and his fellow pilots Werner Voss (Til Schweiger) and Friedrich Sternberg encounter a squadron of enemy planes led by Captain Lanoe Hawker. Richthofen shoots down Canadian pilot Arthur Roy Brown (Joseph Fiennes). After pulling Brown out of the wreckage of his plane, Richthofen assists Nurse KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤te Otersdorf (Lena Headey) with applying a tourniquet to the Canadian's wounded leg.\n\nLater, after successfully shooting down and killing &quot;the notorious Captain Hawker,&quot; Richthofen is awarded the Pour le Merite and promoted to command his own private aerial squadron. There, he is soon joined by his brother Lothar von Richthofen. He orders his men to avoid killing enemy pilots unless absolutely necessary and is enraged when Lothar deliberately strafes and kills a British pilot who has already been forced into a landing.\n\nLater, during an aerial dogfight, Richthofen again encounters Captain Brown, who has escaped from a German POW camp after being nursed by KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤te. Both are forced to ditch their planes in no man's land and share a friendly drink. Brown expresses hope that they will not meet again until after the war is over and tells Richthofen that KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤te has feelings for him. When Richthofen asks how he can be so sure, Brown retorts, &quot;She bitched about you for weeks.&quot;\n\nOn the way back to base, Richthofen is devastated to learn that his close friend, the Jewish pilot Friedrich Sternberg, has been shot down and killed. Over the days that follow, Richthofen makes no secret of his grief and refuses to leave his room. An enraged Lothar reminds him that &quot;A leader cannot afford to mourn.&quot;\n\nShortly thereafter, Richthofen is wounded in the skull and is sent to be nursed by KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤te. As he recovers, the two share a romantic dinner and a dance. After Richthofen expresses gratitude for his wound, an enraged KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤te gives him a tour of a local field hospital and berates him for regarding war as a game.\n\nLater, Richthofen and KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤te are beginning to make love when they are interrupted by an Allied bombing raid. Determined to protect the squadron's aeroplanes, he orders KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤te to hide in the cellar and takes to the air with his men.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365675/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365675/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img519.imageshack.us/img519/9528/theredbaron2009dvdripav.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img519.imageshack.us/img519/9528/theredbaron2009dvdripav.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img638.imageshack.us/img638/9528/theredbaron2009dvdripav.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img638.imageshack.us/img638/9528/theredbaron2009dvdripav.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img39.imageshack.us/img39/9528/theredbaron2009dvdripav.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img39.imageshack.us/img39/9528/theredbaron2009dvdripav.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/9528/theredbaron2009dvdripav.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img651.imageshack.us/img651/9528/theredbaron2009dvdripav.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fdda0f1255a5ba1d673dbc6e87aaca895d1b1b7","amp;dn":"The-Red-Baron%7B2008.DVDrip%7Dvice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fdda0f1255a5ba1d673dbc6e87aaca895d1b1b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,221,160,241,37,90,91,161,214,115,219,198,232,122,172,168,149,209,177,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
