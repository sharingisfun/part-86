Although sold as a thriller in the mould of McGoohan's previous series, Danger Man (called Secret Agent in its U.S. release), the show's combination of 1960s countercultural themes and surreal setting had a far-reaching effect on science fiction/fantasy programming, and on popular culture in general.\n\nDVD Rip, XviD, With Original AC3 Sound\n\nEnjoy!\t\t\nThis is the 2nd of 2 parts.\nGet Part 1 here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5259841/The_Prisoner_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5259841/The_Prisoner_1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94c302ac2448f45dea3396b7c36869e828534113","amp;dn":"The+Prisoner+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94c302ac2448f45dea3396b7c36869e828534113","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,195,2,172,36,72,244,93,234,51,150,183,195,104,105,232,40,83,65,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
