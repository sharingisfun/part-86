You can change the look of buttons and check boxes by assigning them skins, or personalities, and you can assign buttons that will launch programs to toolbars. \n\nYou can create your own skins, choose from the four that are included in the program, or download additional ones. You can also choose to exclude certain programs from WindowBlinds if you don`t want to change their appearances. \n\nApplying visual styles : In addition to the shortcut to the WindowBlinds Advanced Config window in your Start menu, you can change WB visual styles and settings from either the Skins or Appearance tab in Display Properties. \n\nSet the skin to Windows Classic to not use a WB skin on startup (or use the options on the Skins tab or in the Advanced Config window). \nBe sure to check out www.WinCustomize.com to select from over 3200 free visual styles. \nWindowBlinds has been designed and tested to be as compatible with with thousands of applications and pieces of hardware available.
