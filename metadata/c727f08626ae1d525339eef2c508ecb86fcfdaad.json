Some wins have been monuments to his power, and others have been tributes to his precision. Wood's unique skill set was on display again at the recent U.S. Open, but this victory was more visceral. It was all heart&quot;. From NBC Sports, here are the highlights from one of the most amazing performances in Tiger's already illustrious career, the 2008 U.S. Open Championship.&quot; \n\nThis is a DVD that I bought from my local Zellers in Canada yesterday for $5, it's stripped of all Regional restrictions and copy protection.  Since its in a standard ISO format it can be burned on any blank DVD with any burning software program, or you can mount it in any computer (such as PowerISO).\n\nNothing has been stripped from this DVD...I don't to deprive people of those awesome special features to just have improve the video and audio that some people do (I don't see a difference anyway)...\n\nIn the meantime, enjoy this wonderful event in which Tiger barely won this event with only one knee.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c727f08626ae1d525339eef2c508ecb86fcfdaad","amp;dn":"2008+U.S.+Open+-+A+Duel+for+the+Ages.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c727f08626ae1d525339eef2c508ecb86fcfdaad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,39,240,134,38,174,29,82,83,57,238,242,197,8,236,184,111,207,218,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
