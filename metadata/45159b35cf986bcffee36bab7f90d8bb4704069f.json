Jack Larsen (Dylan McDermott) is a recent transfer to the TAU from New York CityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s homicide division, \nwhose confidence, strong personality, and questionable behavior has landed him in trouble beforeÃ¢â‚¬â€but whose past behavior \nmay also prove valuable in his new job. His boss, Lt. Beth Davis (Maggie Q), is strong, focused and an expert in the field, \ndriven by her traumatic personal experience as a victim. With the rest of their team, young but eager Det. Ben Caldwell (Victor Rasuk) \nand deceptively smart Det. Janice Lawrence (Mariana Klaveno), Larsen and Davis assess the threat level of cases and respond before \nthe stalking and intimidation spirals out of control, all while trying to keep their personal obsessions at bay\n\nName: Stalker Music SoundTrack\nTitle: Audio File\nLanguage: English \nReleaser: Couch Potato\nType: Audio File\nLanguage: English \nFormat: .MP3\nTotal Audio Files: 27\nTotal Size: 47.2MB\nTotal Time: 1 hour 38 minutes 39 seconds\nBitrate: 128kbps/Variable\n\nSong List:\nDeftones- Drive (The Cars Cover) (Ft.
