The band was originally composed of guitarist Tasha-Ray Evin, keyboardist Lacey-Lee Evin, bassist Louise Burns, and drummer Sierra Hills. In 2001 the band was signed by Maverick Records and changed their name to Lillix as there was another band called Tigerlily. Hills left in 2002 and was replaced by Kim Urhahn, and later by Alicia Warrington. The Evin sisters announced that as of late 2006 the band was considered on hiatus due to the loss of Burns and Warrington, but with the addition of two new members in early 2007, the band was in the process of rebuilding. The band announced its return in 2009.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3aef825a1833ca41a6c11e77cee0341727ccce7","amp;dn":"Lillix+-+Tomorrow++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3aef825a1833ca41a6c11e77cee0341727ccce7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,174,248,37,161,131,60,164,26,108,17,231,124,238,3,65,114,124,204,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
