'They're wearing highly knitted jumpers. The complex weaves are way beyond anything I can imagine.' Whatever they do, they simply must make friends with them.\r\n\r\nTim has been given a book by Jenny called So You're Going to Be a Dad. He thinks it might be a hint, and Tony tells him he's going to have to master dad skills before their baby arrives. Jenny has tasked Tim with making a cot from scratch.\r\n\r\nEmma is devastated on hearing that Donny Osmond has got married and is in dire need of cheering up. Tim has a go. 'I like you more than I like beer.' 'Is that true?' asks a weepy Emma. 'No. No it isn't.' Tony tells Tim he's going to have to do better than that if he's to master dad skills and dispatches him to the garage to build the cot.\r\n\r\nBrenda and Jenny present themselves to the Scandinavians, Lotte and Marie. They've made a Welcome to Britain box, which doesn't go down quite as well as they might have hoped","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae529cb203e4aa1f1cec0f05e7cf2e8e38eb1fba","amp;dn":"The.Kennedys.2015.s01e03.EN.SUB.x264.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae529cb203e4aa1f1cec0f05e7cf2e8e38eb1fba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,82,156,178,3,228,170,31,28,236,15,5,231,207,46,142,56,235,31,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
