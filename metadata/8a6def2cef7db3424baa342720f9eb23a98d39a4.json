Not everyone was happy to see this story.\n\nMary Madigan: &quot;I watch your show, but frankly I think this story is pathetic. John, you are getting too close to [ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦] Sensational Journalism. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m seeing a story where there is no real story.&quot;\n\nMichael: &quot;This is lazy, sound bite journalism of the worst kind. If there is story there, go find the FACTS, and tell us!&quot;\n\nFortunately, most people liked the show:\n\nLiberty Lover: &quot;John, Great show, just like the other ones. Keep up the good work. I like how you maintain your political independence: criticize lawmakers of both parties when they commit such stupidityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦&quot;\n\nCapt. Karl: &quot;Mr. Stossel, GREAT JOB on this vital subject matter tonight! Thank you&quot;\n\nSome viewers suggested alternative titles for the topic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmercantilism,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsocialism,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcorporatismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.   My wife wanted me to call it the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œun-free market.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½   None of those seemed as clear to me as crony capitalism, so I choose that.\n\nThe show will also re-air Saturday at 7pm EST, and Sunday at 11pm.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a6def2cef7db3424baa342720f9eb23a98d39a4","amp;dn":"20100114-Stossel-%5BCrony+Capitalism%5D.Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a6def2cef7db3424baa342720f9eb23a98d39a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,109,239,44,239,125,179,66,75,170,52,39,32,249,235,35,169,141,57,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
