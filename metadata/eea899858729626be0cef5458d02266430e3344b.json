Today we call that dialect Old English, the ancestor of the language nearly one in five people in the world speaks every day.\n\nHow did this ancient tongue evolve into the elegant idiom of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Twain, Melville, and other great writers? What features of modern English spelling and vocabulary link it to its Old English roots? How did English grammar become so streamlined? Why did its pronunciation undergo such drastic changes? How do we even know what English sounded like in the distant past? And how does English continue to develop to the present day?\n\nThe History of the English Language, 2nd Edition, is Professor Seth Lerer's revised and updated investigation of the remarkable history of English, from the powerful prose of King Alfred in the Middle Ages to the modern-day sermons of Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nThroughout its history, English has been an unusually mutable language, readily accepting new terms and new ways of conveying meaning. Professor Lerer brings this second edition up-to-date by including discussions of the latest changes brought about through such phenomena as hip hop, e-mail, text messaging, and the world wide web.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eea899858729626be0cef5458d02266430e3344b","amp;dn":"TTC+History+of+the+English+Language","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eea899858729626be0cef5458d02266430e3344b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,168,153,133,135,41,98,107,224,206,245,69,141,2,38,100,48,227,52,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
