But now all Tree-ear wants to do is watch master potter Min at work.\n\nCh'ulp'o is a potters' village, famous for delicate celadon ware, and Min is the most brilliant of all potters in Ch'ulp'o. He is also known to be short-tempered. Even so, Tree-ear is drawn irresistibly to Min's workplace. He is fascinated by the miracle of the potter's craft and dream of making a pot of his own someday. His quest leads him down unexpected paths, with hazards and rewards beyond imagining.\n\nThis account of a creative spirit on its journey toward fulfillment is set in twelfth-century Korea, where the course of human destiny could be determined by a single celadon shard.\n\nA Single Shard won the 2002 Newbery Medal for most distinguished American children's book.\n\n\nListening Length: 3 hours and 14 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nType: mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78ca2fe8c0aea73be50e0949266fcf23e03da518","amp;dn":"A+Single+Shard+%28Unabridged%29+by+Linda+Sue+Park","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78ca2fe8c0aea73be50e0949266fcf23e03da518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,202,47,232,192,174,167,59,229,14,9,73,38,111,207,35,224,61,165,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
