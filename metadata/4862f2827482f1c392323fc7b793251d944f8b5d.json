Their lives are as mysterious as their gossamer wings are beautiful. In this book Pieter van Dokkum reveals many of the dragonflyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secrets, capturing the stages of this striking insectÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life cycle in unprecedented close-up photographs. He documents scenes of dragonfly activity seldom witnessed and rarely photographed.\n  \nThe book begins on a moonlit summer night, when an alien-looking larva crawls out of the water and transforms into a fully formed dragonfly. In the following chapters we witness dew-covered dragonflies sparkling in the morning sun, then a pair of mating dragonflies moving through the air in a twelve-legged, eight-winged dance. In the final chapter, one generation dies as the next prepares to leave the water and begin its own winged journey. Each stage is documented through van DokkumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inquisitive lens and accompanied by information on various species of dragonflies and damselflies, their metamorphosis, and their ecological importance as insect predators","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4862f2827482f1c392323fc7b793251d944f8b5d","amp;dn":"Dragonflies+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4862f2827482f1c392323fc7b793251d944f8b5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,98,242,130,116,130,241,195,146,50,63,199,183,147,37,29,148,79,139,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
