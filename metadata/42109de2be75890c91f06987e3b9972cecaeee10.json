Host Eddie Perfect was at the helm, orchestrating a huge night of entertainment. Featuring personalities from across the TV networks, musical numbers by Eddie himself, Missy Higgins, Tripod, Tim Minchin and Home and Away stars among many others and hilarious sketches by top comedians including Frontlines Mike Moore (aka Rob Sitch), Shaun Micallef and Clarke and Dawe was just the start. \r\n\r\nWhat other show would feature Hamish Blake in a toucan outfit, Luke McGregor being hugged by Red Foo from X-Factor and Michala Banas and Shane Jacobson talking about depression before throwing pies in each others faces? \r\n\r\nAll of this was just in the first year of the show. This year we are planning more... so much more! \r\n\r\nOnce again filmed live in front of a studio audience, Eddie Perfect will return to host proceedings. Also guaranteed: loads of Australias biggest stars, catchy tunes, side-splitting comedy and plenty of fun for all the family! \r\n\r\nConcluding Mental As, the ABCs week long initiative supporting Mental Health, Saturday Night Crack Up will form part of a nationwide conversation about mental health while encouraging viewers to donate to mental health research. Last years show was instrumental in helping to raise .5 million for the Society for Mental Health Research. So tune in, enjoy and please give generously","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42109de2be75890c91f06987e3b9972cecaeee10","amp;dn":"Saturday+Night+Crack+Up+2015+360p+LDTV+ABC+AU+WEBRIP+%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42109de2be75890c91f06987e3b9972cecaeee10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,16,157,226,190,117,137,12,145,240,105,135,227,185,151,44,236,174,238,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
