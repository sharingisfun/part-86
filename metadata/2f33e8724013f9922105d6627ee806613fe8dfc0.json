New technologies have been developed to help ensure the production of quality juices without neglecting safety. Covering both new approaches to traditional issues and innovative processes, Juice Processing: Quality, Safety and Value-Added Opportunities addresses various aspects of fruit juice processing and other issues related to the use of by-products generated in this industry.\r\n\r\nThe book begins with a chapter highlighting the importance of the fruit juice sector and describing the general process of fruit juice manufacturing. The text explores current trends in juice production, reviews the main superfruits, and discusses methods for using juice waste by-products, presenting citrus and grape juice as examples. The book covers assessing juice quality and authenticity, and how to evaluate fruit properties using the principles of rheology as well as examining sensory attributes. It also examines alternative techniques for improving fruit juice quality, including both thermal and nonthermal emerging technologies, their fundamentals, and their main effects on important features of fruit juices.\r\n\r\nEmphasizing product quality, safety, and nutrition, the chapter on juice packaging summarizes the materials, techniques, and technologies currently used as well as novel packaging for increasing shelf life and decreasing environmental impact. The authors address issues concerning spoiling microorganisms and biological and chemical hazards. They also examine public and private standards and regulations, which need to be reworked to keep up with todayâ€™s food-related concerns","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f33e8724013f9922105d6627ee806613fe8dfc0","amp;dn":"Juice+Processing+-+Quality%2C+Safety+and+Value-Added+Opportunities","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f33e8724013f9922105d6627ee806613fe8dfc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,51,232,114,64,19,249,146,33,5,214,98,126,232,6,97,63,232,223,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
