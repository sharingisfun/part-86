Roobarb the green dog's enthusiasm for inventions and hairbrained schemes to liven up life in the garden know no bounds. It's up to Custard the indolent, grinning purple cat, and the rest of the garden animals to make sure nothing comes of them so that their idle tranquility can be preserved, and score points off Roobarb's inflated ego at the same time. Some of the episodes defy belief, such as the one in which Roobarb decided Thursday should be Thor's day, and pretends to be the Norse god of thunder. This only incurs the wrath of the real Thor, who responds by turning the hapless dog into a variety of ludicrous shapes, to the hilarity of the other garden animals.\r\n\r\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071043/\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Seed!!\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: Thanks to original uploader on tvchaos","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f837392b82ad7a8c34adaa8e1060187d8800dc3a","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Roobarb+and+Custard+%28BBC+-+1974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f837392b82ad7a8c34adaa8e1060187d8800dc3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,55,57,43,130,173,122,140,52,173,170,142,16,96,24,125,136,0,220,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
