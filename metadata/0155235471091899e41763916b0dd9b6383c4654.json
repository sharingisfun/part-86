The song was written by bandleader Ric Ocasek.\r\n\r\n&quot;Gimme Some Slack&quot; was first released on Panorama, but in 1981, the song was released as the third single from said album. However, the song failed to chart in any countries, making it one of the band's least successful singles. The song has since appeared on the compilation album Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology.\r\n\r\nThe record marked a change from the upbeat pop rock and hard rock of the group's previous albums, representing a more aggressive and experimental sound. It was not as commercially successful as The Cars' previous or subsequent albums (until 1987's Door to Door). However, it did hit #5 on the Billboard 200 chart and has been certified platinum by the RIAA.\r\n\r\nAs a single off the album, the song &quot;Touch and Go&quot; peaked at #37 on the Billboard 200.\r\n\r\nIn his review of Panorama, AllMusic reviewer Greg Prato stated &quot;'Gimme Some Slack' proved to be a fierce rocker.&quot; Prato also said, in his review of Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology, that it was &quot;previously released album tracks [on the album]&quot; that were &quot;highlights.&quot; In the Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology liner notes, Brett Milano said, &quot;Rockers like 'Getting Through' and 'Gimme Some Slack' had a heavier sound than before [Panorama].&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cars are an American rock band that emerged from the new wave scene in the late 1970s. The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts in 1976, with singer, rhythm guitarist and songwriter Ric Ocasek, singer and bassist Benjamin Orr, lead guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson.\r\n\r\nThe Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synthesizer-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flourish in the early 1980s. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described the Cars' musical style by saying: &quot;they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trendsâ€”punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power popâ€”and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe Cars were named &quot;Best New Artist&quot; in the 1978 Rolling Stone Readers' Poll and won &quot;Video of the Year&quot; for &quot;You Might Think&quot; at the first MTV Video Music Awards. Their debut album, The Cars, sold six million copies and appeared on the Billboard 200 album chart for 139 weeks. As of 2001, the Cars have sold over 23 million albums in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe band broke up in 1988, and Ocasek had always discouraged talk of a reunion since then. Orr died in 2000 from pancreatic cancer. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes joined with Todd Rundgren to form a spin-off band, the New Cars, which performed classic Cars and Rundgren songs alongside new material. The original members reunited in 2010 to record a new album, Move Like This, which was released in May 2011, followed by a short tour.\r\n*(video does not have any logos)*\r\n\r\n\r\n    \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimme_Some_Slack \r\n      \nhttp://postimg.org/image/rn1mo1u67/ \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \r\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 9800kbps\r\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\r\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\r\n   Duration: 00:03:28\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \r\nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \r\nIt's 100% free to download and use.
