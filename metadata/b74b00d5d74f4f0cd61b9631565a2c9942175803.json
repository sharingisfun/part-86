In Mecca in the 7th century, Mohammed is visited by a vision of the Angel Gabriel, who urges him to lead the people of Mecca to cast aside the 300 idols of Kaaba and instead worship the one true God. Speaking out against the corrupt political and military leaders who rule Mecca. With the help of his uncle, a brave warrior named Hamza (Anthony Quinn), Mohammed and his followers return to Mecca to liberate the city in the name of God. The Message (originally screened in the U.S. as Mohammed, Messenger of God) proved to be highly controversial during its production and initial release. The Message was shot in two versions, one in English and one in Arabic (entitled Al-Ris-Alah), with different actors taking over some of the roles due to language requirements. \r\n\r\nVideo: DivX 5 720x400 23.98fps [Stream 00]\r\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 44100Hz stereo 128Kbps [Stream 01]\r\n\r\n\r\nProducer Moustapha Akkad\r\nAudio/Visual sound, color\r\nLanguage English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b74b00d5d74f4f0cd61b9631565a2c9942175803","amp;dn":"The+Message+Islamic+Movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b74b00d5d74f4f0cd61b9631565a2c9942175803","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,75,0,213,215,79,79,12,214,27,150,49,86,90,44,153,66,23,88,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
