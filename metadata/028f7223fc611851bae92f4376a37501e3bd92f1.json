He befriends her, Calls her Munni (Harshaali Malhotra) and virtually adopts her, thinking she is a Hindu and a Brahmin. Later he finds out, through a series of incidents, that She is a Muslim and a Pakistani at that. He decides to restore her to her parents. He has no Passport, no visa and no contacts, only his faith and his love for Munni. He crosses over to Pakistan illegally.\r\n\r\nIn Pakistan he is befriended by a journalist, Chand Nawab (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), who believes his tale. This unlikely trio now faces danger and many adventures as Bajrangi is labelled an Indian Spy. What they do next is the story of Bajrangi Bhaijaan.\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nIt is an unusual theme - restoring a lost child to her parents across a hostile border and perhaps it is the pent up goodwill among the peoples of the two countries that made this film the superhit it became. The other reason was probably Harshaali Malhotra, with her dimpled cheeks and winning ways. She effortlessly wins your heart, not just that of Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Fortunately, we don't meet such little girls everyday, or a continuous cross-border traffic would emerge!\r\n\r\nSalman Khan is his usual self. Part heroic, part naive and with an unalloyed golden heart. The role is written with him in mind and he hams his way through. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is outstanding as the Pakistani journalist. Kareena Kapoor has little to do except look pretty, which she manages to be in occasional scenes.\r\n\r\nYet, despite the crazy tale, the Director makes the film almost believable, thanks to a very taut screenplay. Remember, this film goes on for about 2Â½ hours. It repeatedly touches your heartstrings with some incidents that are commonplace but seeks to show that people are the same everywhere.\r\n\r\nMusic adds to the film, despite the accusations of copyright violation. Editing is excellent and so is camera work.\r\n\r\nIts not a film for rational thought. Its really a fairy tale, but everyone of us is a little child inside and everyone loves a good fairy tale!\r\n\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nBajrangi Bhaijaan was released on Eid Day in July 2015. I am glad that I am able to bring you this exclusive x265 rip on the day of Eid-al-Adha in India as well.\r\n\r\nI have cleaned up the image a bit, emphasized detail, increased luminance and reduced the pinkishness of the original video in the DVD. I think you will like the result. Please check the sample as well. It is from the center of the film.\r\n\r\nThis is a 10-bit HEVC encoding. The banding and excess blocking in the original video could be reduced through this encoding. This encoding and its higher compressibility has also allowed me to reduce the file size to just 697 MB. Yet, as you can see from the samples, the quality is excellent, even if I say so myself!\r\n\r\nPlease note that this rip (and all HEVC rips) will not play on any stand-alone device. You can only watch this on a computer. Be sure that you have the latest versions of VLC (2.1.5 or higher) or Media Player Classic (Ver 1.7.9) or SMPlayer (14.9.0). Earlier versions may not work\r\n\r\nIMDB Link: \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt3863552/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:028f7223fc611851bae92f4376a37501e3bd92f1","amp;dn":"Bajrangi.Bhaijaan.%282015%29-DVD.Rip-HEVC-x265.AAC.Esubs-1CD-%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"028f7223fc611851bae92f4376a37501e3bd92f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,143,114,35,252,97,24,81,186,233,47,67,118,163,117,1,227,189,146,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
