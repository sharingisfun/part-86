I saw a sneak screening in Hollywood with people off the street who also didn't know it existed. All that said, it's the best movie I've seen this year. The lead actor is a guy whose girlfriend got killed by a crooked cop. He's a miserable wreck doing nothing with his life except mope and watch old videos of her. Then he ends up with a video game that somehow sucks you into another world. (I'm not clear on how or why he gets the game. That could have been made clearer.) He ends up meeting his dead ex in the other world and the cop who killed her is now an evil gangster trying to kill him. Everything is clever and well thought out and people were crying at the end. I don't know if it's going into the theaters or coming out in blockbuster but you're getting your money's worth either way.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97cf1619f62c14112f2d83da575deba74e09f7f1","amp;dn":"Gamebox1.DVDRip.ENG-LGLUX.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97cf1619f62c14112f2d83da575deba74e09f7f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,207,22,25,246,44,20,17,47,45,131,218,87,93,235,167,78,9,247,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
