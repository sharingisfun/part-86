This clearly makes the hazards associated with the handling of materials subject to either cause or react to electrostatic discharge of vital importance to anyone associated with their handling or industrial bulk use. This book provides a comprehensive guide to the dangers of static electricity and how to avoid them. It will prove invaluable to safety managers and professionals, as well as all personnel involved in the activities concerned, in the chemical, agricultural, pharmaceutical and petrochemical process industries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe book makes extended use of case studies to illustrate the principles being expounded, thereby making it far more open, accessible and attractive to the practitioner in industry than the highly theoretical texts which are also available. \r\n\r\nThe authors have many years' experience in the area behind them, including the professional teaching of the content provided here. GÃ¼nter LÃ¼ttgens is a widely acknowledged consultant who travels Europe providing training to major industrial corporations on this subject, whilst Norman Wilson practices what is written here in his professional capacity with the British Textile Technology Group. \r\n\r\nExtended use of case studies to illustrate the principles.This makes the book far more open, accessible and attractive to the practitioner in industry than the highly theoretical texts also available.\r\n\r\nAuthors have many years experience in the area\r\n\r\nBoth authors have been widely published with considerable previous book-writing experience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b84b690fd9cfd320e4eef8556f34bdd998cb5d1","amp;dn":"Electrostatic+Hazards","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b84b690fd9cfd320e4eef8556f34bdd998cb5d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,132,182,144,253,156,253,50,14,78,239,133,86,243,75,221,153,140,181,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
