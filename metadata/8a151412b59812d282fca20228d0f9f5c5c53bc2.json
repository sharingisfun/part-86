Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuests: Chris Distefano\r\n\r\nEpisode 249: A brand new week kicks off with a recap of Anthonyâ€™s weekend that included plenty of drunken karaoke, a little bit of loneliness, serial killer searches, and ice-cream sandwiches. Ant announces Pat Dixonâ€™s â€œNYC Crime Reportâ€ is now a network member, he sings the praises of the Mets, brings up the Back to the Future/Cubs prediction, and Chris Distefano joins the show to talk about his baby, the ease of knocking his chick up, and his transition from single guy to family man. The guys then discuss Chrisâ€™s gorgeous face on the road, cheating, handing off your cell phone, growing comedically, assholes on social media, fair-weather sports fans, shitty seats at Barclays Center, and gun policies at arenas. They chat about Lamar Odom, the Kardashians, Bieberâ€™s giant dick, Rhea Perlman, Jay Thomas, late night TV, Japan and Germany then and now, and the word on the streets about Bernie Sanders. We watch this weekendâ€™s clip of Larry David on SNL, Ant dumps on socialism, they discuss Trump and Hillary, attempts at new gun laws, Campbellâ€™s soup and the gays, Halloween for kids, kiddie pranks, the menâ€™s locker room, and old school locker room antics. Ant talks about Jon Stewartâ€™s (not that one) dick pics, we hear about Chrisâ€™s gig on IFCâ€™s Benders, they chat about crossing lines as sports fans, and end the day Jocketobering â€œThe Charlie &amp; Debbie Showâ€ and â€œTanner in the Morningâ€ as a bonus.\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a151412b59812d282fca20228d0f9f5c5c53bc2","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-10-19+Chris+Distefano+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a151412b59812d282fca20228d0f9f5c5c53bc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,21,20,18,181,152,18,210,130,252,162,2,40,208,249,245,197,197,59,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
