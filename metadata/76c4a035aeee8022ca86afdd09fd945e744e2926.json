It covers the period from the 1890s to the end of World War I, and essentially follows the suffrage movement as it was influenced by Richard Pankhurst, a Manchester barrister and a believer in women's rights, and as it was championed by his wife, Emmeline, and their daughters, Christabel and Sylvia. The six-part drama originally aired on the BBC then on `Masterpiece Theatre' in the US.\r\n\r\nSian Phillips as Emmeline Pankhurst\r\n  \r\nPatricia Quinn as Christabel Pankhurst\r\n  \r\nAngela Down as Sylvia Pankurst\r\n  \r\nGeorgia Brown as Annie Kenney\r\n  \r\nMichael Gough as Dr. Richard PankhurstFormat \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you've just seen the movie Suffragette (2015) this covers the history in a bit more detail.\r\n\r\nNever released on DVD so these are copies of a previous broadcast recording. \r\n\r\nVideo quality is low but sound fine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76c4a035aeee8022ca86afdd09fd945e744e2926","amp;dn":"Shoulder+to+Shoulder+1974","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76c4a035aeee8022ca86afdd09fd945e744e2926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,196,160,53,174,238,128,34,202,134,175,221,9,253,148,94,116,78,41,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
