They come from good old school of death'n'roll, still maintaining heavy-as-fuck sound, but merging it with very emotional approach to melody, not forgetting good technicality. Catchy and brutal, they always deliver high quality music, which is proved by their last outing &quot;To Those Who Walk Behind Us&quot;. I tried to find the best versions of their albums, plus the covers. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.
