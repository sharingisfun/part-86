The terms ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPESÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWinning ElevenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ have always been synonymous with realism and superior gameplay, but this year PES will further narrow the gap between the game, and the real thing! New stadiums, players, motions and gameplay modes will bolster a game already focused on providing an exciting soccer experience. In 2009, Pro Evolution will once again push the limits of soccer gaming with the addition of the UEFA Champions League mode. Now the most prestigious soccer tournament in Europe is at your fingertips. If it were any more real, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d be on the field!\n\nPES will test your soccer wits and build your understanding of the game by allowing you complete control of your players on the field. The controller settings allow you to run precision lines to split up defenses and on-point precise passes. Your shots on goal will be more accurate based on your skills and your position relative to the goal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d012bbbf92d96e0c353e797c25089385d32b3e33","amp;dn":"Pro+Evolution+Soccer+2009+%5BWii%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d012bbbf92d96e0c353e797c25089385d32b3e33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,18,187,191,146,217,110,12,53,62,121,124,37,8,147,133,211,43,62,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
