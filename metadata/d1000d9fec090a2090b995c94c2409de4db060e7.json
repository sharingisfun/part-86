Abdul Kalam\r\n\r\nOverview: As India chooses its 16th Lok Sabha in 2014, and voters across the country are debating and discussing matters related to governance and elections, this book, from someone who has observed our national life at close quarters, is a visionary statement for every citizen to read and understand.\r\nDr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who was Indiaâ€™s eleventh President, and has been a scientist, a technocrat, a teacher and thinker, brings his vast experience and keen eye for detail to bear in discussing various aspects of governance. He articulates a vision for India and what each citizen must do to make it a realityâ€”it is only by being honest, morally upright, and by working hard that we can achieve the mission of a developed India. Dr Kalam also proposes realistic, step-by-step solutions to issues of corruption, governance and accountability. Optimistic, progressive and positive, he dreams of an India that can achieve wholesome development for every citizen.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) The Guiding Light: A Selection of Quotations from My Favourite Books by A.P.J.

In The Guiding Light, he chooses the finest examples of writings from the numerous books, religious texts, philosophical tracts and poetry that he has read over the years.

In a century that many experts predict may belong to India; the realization of the vision of a better future for everyone will require a keen understanding of our needs and this can only be achieved by tailoring our research and innovations to the goal of national development. \r\n\r\nDont miss the first part:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.la/torrent/12165652/Dr._A.P.J._Abdul_Kalam_Books__%28RIP%29","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1000d9fec090a2090b995c94c2409de4db060e7","amp;dn":"Dr.+A.P.J.+Abdul+Kalam+Books+2+%28Happy+B+day+Sir+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1000d9fec090a2090b995c94c2409de4db060e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,0,13,159,236,9,10,32,144,185,149,201,76,36,9,222,77,176,96,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
