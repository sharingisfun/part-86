The three settle in and proceed to have a fun time with booze, drugs and talk. What appears to be a night where a drug deal is supposed to go off without a hitch soon hits a snag once it turns out that Fawn and Lainey have a double-crossing plan up their sleeves. Needless to say, their little plan backfires and they are soon met with the wrath of Junior's big buddy Angel, a truly ruthless character. Junior, along with the help of Angel, turn Fawn and Lainey's sleazy operation into a depraved, brutality-filled evening of torture and unspeakable acts.\r\n\r\nBig Junior doesn't look to be something truly memorable when it first starts out, but soon it takes a very sick turn and the sleazy characters, dialogue and atmosphere make the film totally nasty, offensive, raw, gritty, and brutal fun. The very claustrophobic setting really adds to the effectiveness of it all. Big Junior is an interesting movie in that it is not what you'd expect and is not a traditional movie in any sense. There isn't a typical linear plotline to follow of characters, conflict, and resolution. There is a story buried in the insanity and depravity, but the movie is more about the events that unfold in a motel room over a single night. It becomes more of a viewing experience rather than a method of storytelling and sometimes it jumps from a surreal quasi-experimental freak-out to a very twisted crime flick.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 704x480, 29.970 fps, 2149 kbps, 01h21m18s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4iz82q2ix/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/6aqmqh3i3/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/usiqed62j/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/819nryl17/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/d3kovflpt/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7e7c94f4fbcb9b450b9bbe632f77e776070cb29","amp;dn":"Big+Junior+%282010%29+Hollywood+drug+deal+turns+very+very+nasty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7e7c94f4fbcb9b450b9bbe632f77e776070cb29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,231,201,79,79,188,185,180,80,185,187,230,50,247,126,119,96,112,203,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
