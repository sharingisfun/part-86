The current lineup includes guitarist/singer John Bell, bassist Dave Schools, drummer Duane Trucks, percussionist Domingo &quot;Sunny&quot; Ortiz, keyboardist John &quot;JoJo&quot; Hermann, and guitarist Jimmy Herring. Michael Houser and George McConnell have also played lead guitar for the band.\r\n\r\nSince their inception in Athens, Georgia, in 1986, Widespread Panic has risen to elite status among American jam bands. Following in the steps of other Southern rock jam bands such as The Allman Brothers Band, they draw influences from the Southern rock, blues-rock, progressive rock, funk and hard rock genres. They are frequently compared to other jam band &quot;road warriors&quot; such as the Grateful Dead and Phish. Widely renowned for their live performances, as of 2013, they hold the record for number of sold-out performances at Red Rocks Amphitheatre (Morrison, Colorado) at 42 and Philips Arena (Atlanta, Georgia) at 20.\r\n\r\nWidespread Panic havenâ€™t released a studio record since 2010â€²s Dirty Side Down. On their Vanguard debut, they pull off a first in their nearly 30-year career. These ten songs were cut with WP playing live from the floor of Echo Mountain Studios in Asheville, North Carolina (an old church). Most were first takes, though there are a few minimal overdubs, and the band worked with longtime producer John Keane and featured temporary drummer Duane Trucks (Derekâ€™s younger brother) â€” founding kitman Todd Nance went on sabbatical in 2014. The mix here is vibrant and warm; the live presentation creates a spacious dynamic that leaves WPâ€™s spiky grit intact. Opener â€œSell Sellâ€ is a cover of Alan Priceâ€™s Brit R&amp;B nugget, from his film score for Lindsay Andersonâ€™s 1973 film O Lucky Man!, which starred Malcolm McDowell. There isnâ€™t anything retro about this stoned, trancey groover though.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n1. Sell Sell 6:24\r\n2. Stevenâ€™s Cat 4:28\r\n3. Cease Fire 7:51\r\n4.
