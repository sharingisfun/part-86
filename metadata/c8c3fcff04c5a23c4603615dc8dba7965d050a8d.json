Survival depends on your magic, your sword, and your wits. \r\nLegends of Dawn Reborn takes place in a world of Narr and events take place before those from Wave of Darkness released on Steam Early Access in June. \r\nWhat makes Legends of Dawn Reborn unique is an ability to play without restrictions. The world of Narr is a huge place, where you won't stumble upon &quot;invisible walls&quot;, or loading screens. \r\nThe world of Narr spans across continents through stunning picturesque landscape that stimulates the mind. There are magical regions where the mountains and hills defy gravity, buoyant as balloons. We have also created countless dungeons awaiting for you to discover what mysteries lie within their cold depths, as well as camps, impressive docks and grim fortresses that bear silent witness to battles. Mausoleums and cemeteries also await your exploration","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8c3fcff04c5a23c4603615dc8dba7965d050a8d","amp;dn":"Legends+of+Dawn+Reborn+v2.01s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8c3fcff04c5a23c4603615dc8dba7965d050a8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,195,252,255,4,197,162,60,70,3,97,93,200,219,167,150,93,5,10,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
