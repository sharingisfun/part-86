It started in 2014 airing on Saturdays and Sundays.  Each show features the best in current and classic progressive rock.  Some shows have interviews with prog luminaries and others feature prog legends guest hosting and choosing the music (for example, Steven Wilson/Tim Bowness and Steve Hogarth of Marillion).     \r\n\r\nThese MP3s were downloaded directly from the TeamRock website using a custom program written in Java (they are not currently visible on the site for streaming, but they are still on the site's servers, which was discovered through a bit of detective work).  The MP3s are original as found on the server, with no re-encoding performed (each show is about 2 hours long and 200 MB in size).\r\n\r\nHere are the Prog Magazine radio shows included in this torrent (interviews and guest hosts noted):\r\n\r\n2014-05-10 \r\n2014-05-11 \r\n2014-05-17 \r\n2014-05-18 \r\n2014-05-24 \r\n2014-05-25 \r\n2014-05-31 \r\n2014-06-01   (Jordan Rudess interview)\r\n2014-06-07 \r\n2014-06-08   (Justin Greaves interview)\r\n2014-06-14 \r\n2014-06-15 \r\n2014-06-21 \r\n2014-06-22   (Chris Squire interview)\r\n2014-06-28 \r\n2014-06-29 \r\n2014-07-05 \r\n2014-07-06   (Ian Anderson interview)\r\n2014-07-12 \r\n2014-07-13   (Anna Phoebe interview)\r\n2014-07-19   (Steven Wilson and Tim Bowness guest hosting Part 1)\r\n2014-07-20   (Steven Wilson and Tim Bowness guest hosting Part 2)\r\n2014-07-26   (Steve Hogarth guest hosting Part 1)\r\n2014-07-27   (Steve Hogarth guest hosting Part 2)\r\n2014-08-02 \r\n2014-08-03   (Ray Shulman interview)\r\n2014-08-09 \r\n2014-08-10   (Top 100 Albums)\r\n2014-08-16 \r\n2014-08-17   (Steve Hackett session)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f620a8c86b5661133d6e78bde98ac2d8c8d9bffc","amp;dn":"Prog+Magazine+Radio+Show+Torrent+%231+%28progressive+rock%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f620a8c86b5661133d6e78bde98ac2d8c8d9bffc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,32,168,200,107,86,97,19,61,110,120,189,233,138,194,216,200,217,191,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
