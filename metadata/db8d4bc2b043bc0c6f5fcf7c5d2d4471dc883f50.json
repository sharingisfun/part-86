All animals rely on plants for their survival. This is not an accident - they are the most powerful evolutionary force on Earth. Plants enabled amphibians to leave the water, they had a hand in the rise and fall of the dinosaurs, and they ensured the ultimate triumph of insects, mammals, birds and even us - all for their own benefit. Because plants have only ever had one goal - the total domination of the planet. It is a story of ruthless ingenuity, seduction and deception; of unimaginable power and ambition. An epic tale, How to Grow a Planet offers a stunning new perspective on Earth history. \r\n\r\nVideo: m4v container, h264, 720p\r\nAudio: AAC, 48kHz, 2 channels, English, Russian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db8d4bc2b043bc0c6f5fcf7c5d2d4471dc883f50","amp;dn":"How+To+Grow+A+Planet+%282012%29+720p+h264+Full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db8d4bc2b043bc0c6f5fcf7c5d2d4471dc883f50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,141,75,194,176,67,188,12,111,95,207,124,93,45,68,113,220,136,63,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
