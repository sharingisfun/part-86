Bartlett previously created Hey Arnold!, and worked on Rugrats, Sid the Science Kid, and the Penny cartoons for Pee-wee's Playhouse.\n\nThe series features a curious young Tyrannosaurus Rex named Buddy who, together with his adopted Pteranodon family, takes the Dinosaur Train to explore his time period, and have adventures with all kinds of dinosaurs. It is produced by The Jim Henson Company in association with Media Development Authority, Sparky Animation, FableVision, and Snee-Oosh, Inc.\n\nThe show is set in a whimsical prehistoric world of jungles, swamps, active volcanoes and oceans, all teeming with dinosaur and other animal life, and connected by a train line known as the Dinosaur Train. This steam-engine train can be customized for dinosaurs of all kinds: windows accommodate the long-necked sauropods, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plenty of headroom in the Observation Car for the larger theropods, and the Aquacar is an aquarium for sea-going passengers. The train itself is run by Troodons, as the smartest dinosaurs in this fictional universe. The Dinosaur Train circles the whole worldÃ¢â‚¬â€it even crosses the oceans and inland seas, with stops to visit undersea prehistoric animals. It can travel through the entire Mesozoic Era, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Age of Dinosaurs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ passing through magical Time Tunnels to the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous time periods.\n\nThe world of Dinosaur Train is seen through the eyes of Buddy the Tyrannosaurus. In the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main title song, we learn that Buddy was adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Pteranodon. He hatched at the same time as his pteranodon siblings Tiny, Shiny, and Don. By traveling in the Dinosaur Train around the Mesozoic, supplied with all dinosaur facts by the trainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Troodon Conductor, Buddy learns that he is a Tyrannosaurus. As an adopted kid in a mixed-species family, Buddy is curious about the differences between species and vows to learn about all the dinosaurs he can by riding the Dinosaur Train. The dinosaurs featured in the show are actual dinosaurs discovered by paleontologists.\n\nHere's a pack of all the second season episodes not previously available on TPB, including the Dinosaur Train Submarine episodes. Encoded by me, using DVR recordings from my local PBS station.\n\nThanks to burnrome for posting torrents of season one and most of season two.
