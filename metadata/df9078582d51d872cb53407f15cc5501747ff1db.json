It is a world where armed camps of eco-survivalists battle purveyors of technology. Where once-thriving suburbs have crumbled into treacherous Wilds. Welcome to the dawn of uncivilization.\n\nMETAtropolis is an intelligent, stunning creation of five of today's cutting-edge science fiction writers: 2008 Hugo Award winners John Scalzi and Elizabeth Bear; Campbell Award winner Jay Lake; plus fan favorites Tobias Buckell and Karl Schroeder. Together they set the ground rules and developed the parameters of this &quot;shared universe&quot;, then wrote five original novellas; all linked, but each a separate tale.\n\nBringing this audiobook to life is a dream team of performers: Battlestar Galactica's Michael Hogan (&quot;Saul Tigh&quot;); Alessandro Juliani (&quot;Felix Gaeta&quot;); and Kandyse McClure (&quot;Anastasia 'Dee' Dualla&quot;); plus legendary audiobook narrators Scott Brick (Dune) and Stefan Rudnicki (Ender's Game).\n\nJohn Scalzi, who served as Project Editor, introduces each story, offering insight into how the METAtropolis team created this unique project exclusively for digital audio.&quot;\n\nNo longer available on Audible.com.
