Finbar gets the chance to play soccer in an international soccer team abroad but can't use it and comes back. He went as a hero and came back as loser. Even the relation to Danny gets worse. In an act of desperation he jumps from a bridge and just disappears. After years of missing Finbar, he calls Danny from Sweden and Danny follows this call disappearing from this neighbourhood, too. In an odyssey, Danny travels from Stockholm to the far north of Sweden, to Lappland, looking for Finbar. Up there, he does not only meet Finbar but also very nice people and the lovely Abbi. But the friendship to Finbar has changed and their lives eventually separate","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35e6e91dd6d6128956c7b39f09e5c313eb9ac5ff","amp;dn":"The+Disappearance+of+Finbar+1996.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35e6e91dd6d6128956c7b39f09e5c313eb9ac5ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,230,233,29,214,214,18,137,86,199,179,159,9,229,195,19,235,154,197,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
