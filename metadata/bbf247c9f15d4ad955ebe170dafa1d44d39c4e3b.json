Not really, if you expect artistry. But this smorgasbord of popular international musical stars brings together extreme musical genres for an excellent purpose, and is enjoyable enough for almost anyone. Pavarotti's relaxed and buoyant leadership and still gorgeous tenor add beauty to the rock/pop selections. Trisha Yearwood, Celine Dion, and Stevie Wonder impressively hold their own against Opera Spice; but the other artists pale against the master's presence. The Spice Girls will never be confused with Anonymous 4; Zucchero's growling is scary; Florent Pagny exemplifies French rock; and Pino Daniele's breathy tenor is mellow and soothing. Best for those wanting to experience Pavarotti's vocal beauty in a more popular idiom","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbf247c9f15d4ad955ebe170dafa1d44d39c4e3b","amp;dn":"Pavarotti+%26amp%3B+Friends+-+For+The+Children+of+Liberia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbf247c9f15d4ad955ebe170dafa1d44d39c4e3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,242,71,201,241,93,74,217,85,235,225,112,218,250,29,68,211,156,78,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
