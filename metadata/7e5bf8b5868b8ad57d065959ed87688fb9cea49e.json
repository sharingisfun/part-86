Tonight! Sold Out!! is a video album released by the grunge band Nirvana on laserdisc and VHS on November 15, 1994. The DVD version was released November 7, 2006.\n\nThe video was originally conceived by Kurt Cobain himself and it was to loosely chronicle the band's rise to fame and the Nevermind era.[1] When Kurt Cobain died in 1994 the video lay unfinished so remaining Nirvana band members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic stepped in to finish it. The video includes live performances as well as interviews with the band.[1] Amongst the live performances is a &quot;disturbing&quot; performance of &quot;Love Buzz&quot; in which Cobain gets into a fight with an over aggressive bouncer.[1]\n\nMost of the live footage is from 1991 and 1992, with home video footage dating back to late-1990. The latest footage is from January 23, 1993 at the Hollywood Rock Festival in Brazil","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e5bf8b5868b8ad57d065959ed87688fb9cea49e","amp;dn":"NIRVANA+-+Live.in.Concert.720p.HD.xH264.-The.Buzzsaw","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e5bf8b5868b8ad57d065959ed87688fb9cea49e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,91,248,181,134,139,138,213,125,6,89,89,237,135,104,143,185,206,164,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
