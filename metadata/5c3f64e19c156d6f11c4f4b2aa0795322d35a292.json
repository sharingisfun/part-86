Lionel joins TACS to discuss shitty radio, editing yourself for radio, radio gimmicks vs. being shocking, gun laws, commercials these days, medicine and side effects, the media twisting stories, and the foundation of America. After a shameless plug from Lionel, the guys talk about the homeless, social media, cons, Al Gore, the earthâ€™s metals, the many names of ISIS, Gaddafi, mass shootings, the ideology of the news, the â€œwar on drugs,â€œ the left versus the right, Kim Davis, ostracized women, and picking and choosing stories to make â€œnewsworthy.â€ They end the show talking about Comic-Con, Matt Damon, being overly offended, being forced to generalize, the gays, pedos, free thinking, varying opinions, and fuck it, just tune in because they talk about a lot of things because boy oh boy can Lionel yap!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c3f64e19c156d6f11c4f4b2aa0795322d35a292","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-10-05+Jocktober+%26amp%3B+Lionel+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c3f64e19c156d6f11c4f4b2aa0795322d35a292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,63,100,225,156,21,109,111,17,196,244,178,170,7,149,50,45,53,162,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
