they\n        were the megafauna. In Australia  some of the most bizarre  to\n        roam  the  earth  existed including  a  giant  wombat, a  huge\n        kangaroo, a massive lizard and the earth's biggest  flightless\n        bird. For hundreds of thousands of years these were the  heavy\n        weight champions of the animal kingdom.\n\n        But suddenly, inexplicably  they vanished. Something  happened\n        which wiped them off the face of the planet forever.\n\n        While  there  have  been  several  mass  extinctions  of large\n        terrestrial   animals   throughout  history,   the   death  of\n        Australia's megafauna is  relatively recent. It  occurred less\n        than 60,000 years ago and no one knows why. It remains one  of\n        the longest running and hotly argued debates in palaeontology.\n        For decades scientific sleuths from around the world have been\n        trying to solve the mystery.\n\n        Now in a unique corner of the world, a team of top  scientists\n        from around the world attempt  to crack one of sciences  most\n        enduring mysteries - what  killed the megafauna in  Australia?\n        Their discoveries could  not only help  solve the mystery  but\n        also offer insight into environmental problems which  threaten\n        the world and all life today.\n\n        As  the  scientists  begin  their  quest  this   extraordinary\n        prehistoric world is brought to life using the latest in  high\n        quality 3D animation.\n \n \n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n \n \n                                Deanna Abbott\n                                Josh Abdullah\n                                Gerard Ashwin\n                                Tarlia Bennett\n                                Heath Bergersen\n                                Justine Graham\n                                Robert Graham\n                                Trevor Jamieson\n                                Glen Moore\n                                Bronwyn Newland\n                                Glen Ridley\n                                Craig Sechler\n                                Leighton Shaw\n                                Lynn Webb\n                                Derek Wolgar\n \n \n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n \n \n                                    Enjoy!\n \n \n \n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        9 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n \n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        9 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n \n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n        * 100mbit or gigabit archive sites for TV/XVID/ETC.\n        * 1080p or 720p rippers pre retail or classics\n        * Fios cappers in u.s\n        * U.K or Pre Retail Dvdrippers\n        * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage   \n        * If you think you can help contact us on irc,\n          or email us on &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7d3b120f1e183d15080e15531c14&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ced5ac837f55a7cf893a66fd1ae03e536fc91e9","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Death.Of.The.Megabeasts.2009.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ced5ac837f55a7cf893a66fd1ae03e536fc91e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,237,90,200,55,245,90,124,248,147,166,111,209,174,3,229,54,252,145,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
