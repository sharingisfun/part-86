He continued to develop his abilities with musical giants like Tony Martin (BLACK SABBATH), Graham Bonnet (RAINBOW, MSG), Don Airey (RAINBOW, OZZY OSBOURNE, DEEP PURPLE) and several others.\r\n\r\nWith the first VOODOO HILL album in 2000, Dario, had the chance to have a proper international release, \r\n&quot;Waterfall&quot; came about as a result &quot;of the most prolific and creative period I had in my entire career,&quot; says Dario. &quot;I wrote and recorded more than 35 song ideas in a very limited amount of time, leveraging from all the experiences I gathered as a guitar player, writer and producer. \r\nThis creative phase had a further development when Dario Patti (keyboardist, bass player and orchestra arranger) came into the picture.\r\nSo I used very old school recording methods, including recording acoustic drums in rooms with natural reverb.\r\n&quot;He said Glenn Hughes was available,so the next thing I did was to choose the 11 songs which I thought suited the project the best. \r\n&quot;Waterfall&quot; is a strong and straightforward hard and heavy rock album which is equally split between aggressive and heavy moments and beautiful melodies.\r\n\r\n&quot;Waterfall&quot; track listing:\r\n\r\n01. All That Remains\r\n02. The Well\r\n03. Rattle Shake Bone\r\n04. Underneath And Down Below\r\n05. Waterfall\r\n06. Karma Go\r\n07. Evil Thing\r\n08. Eldorado\r\n09. White Feather\r\n10.
