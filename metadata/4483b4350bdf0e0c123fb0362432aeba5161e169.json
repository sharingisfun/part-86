Discover 120 sensational cake recipes from the founder and members of Britain's first and only underground cake club.\r\nSecret venues, inspired themes, and fabulous cakes. Across the UK and beyond, thousands of home bakers have been meeting covertly in hidden locations with the same simple mission: bake, eat, and gossip about cake. These are the members of the phenomenally popular Clandestine Cake Clubâ€”and now, for the first time, they share their baking secrets. The rules are quite clear: no cupcakes, no muffins, no brownies, pies, or tarts. It's all about cake! With each event organized around a creative theme, the results are some of the most loved and inventive baked delights you'll ever eat. The inspiring recipes include Scrumptious Sticky Toffee Cake; Smoked Chili Chocolate Cake; Blood Orange and Rosemary Loaf; Dark'n'Stormy Cake; Rose, Rhubarb &amp; Cardamom Cake; Chai-soaked Vanilla Sponge; a giant Lemon Fondant Fancy; and the unmissable five-tier Rainbow Cake; all presented with stunning photography and sneak-peek snaps from club events. At last, the secret is out and everyone is invited to join the Club. Includes metric measures.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nLynn Hill founded the Clandestine Cake Club in 2010 as a follow-up to the successful Secret Tea Room that she was already running in her home. There are now more than 150 affiliated clubs in the UK and elsewhere.
