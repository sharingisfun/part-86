Rather than an unwieldy dump of thousands of issues that are meticulously numbered and ordered (and whose filenames screw with modern comic reader parsers), the Chronology is presented as a series of ad-hoc collections with a simple volume ordering. I'll be releasing these in series of 10 volumes a piece.\r\n\r\nAs with previous releases of this chronology, strict chronology order has been followed as close as possible, though some flexibility and &quot;grain of salt&quot; needs to be used for proper interpretation. Books have been culled from a variety of sources and all credit goes to the original scanners/rippers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bfeee388ea3df54e8923a4f26775d40b4aeb2cd","amp;dn":"Superman+Post-Crisis+Chronology%2C+Volumes+251-260","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bfeee388ea3df54e8923a4f26775d40b4aeb2cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,254,238,56,142,163,223,84,232,146,58,79,38,119,93,64,180,174,178,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
