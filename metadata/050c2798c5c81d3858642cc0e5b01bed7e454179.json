Maybe all Sharpnel's tracks are around 5 minutes long and I've of course got 'em all. Reason: the streams didn't got their id3 tags updated correctly (maybe some tracks didn't got any), so my ripping software kept recording multiple tracks in a single file. Don't worry: I used 2 recording threads a few days long to make sure I got as much as possible before the shutdown.\n\nFiles got transcoded in MP3, 96 kb/s CBR.\n\nENJOY !\n\n\n\n- if you like this music, do as me: buy Dj Sharpnel's great CDs !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:050c2798c5c81d3858642cc0e5b01bed7e454179","amp;dn":"HARDRAVE.jp+stream+rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"050c2798c5c81d3858642cc0e5b01bed7e454179","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,12,39,152,197,200,29,56,88,100,44,192,229,176,27,237,126,69,65,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
