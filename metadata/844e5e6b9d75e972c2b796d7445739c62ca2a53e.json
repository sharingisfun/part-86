The album becomes ever more pertinent with track titles interwoven into the chapters of a book that resonate with reality over what has been a truly groundbreaking and unpredictable journey. Long Lost Suitcase is the heart and soul of a performer who is still willing to push the boundaries.\r\n\r\nOnce more, Lost Long Suitcase sees producer Ethan Johns cajole some extraordinary performances from Tom and a select group of players courtesy of a diverse catalogue of compositions from the likes of Gillian Welch, Rolling Stones through to Hank Williams and The Milk Carton Kids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArtists:................-Tom Jones\r\nAlbum Name:.............-Long Lost Suitcase\r\nFormat:.................-MP3\r\nBitrate:................-320kbps\r\nSize:...................-115 MB\r\nTracks:.................-13\r\nTotal Time:.............-41:41\r\nGenre:..................-Rock/Blues/Country\r\nCountry:................-Wales\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
