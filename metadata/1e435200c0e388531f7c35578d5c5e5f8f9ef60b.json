Her soothing vocals shine through, evoking an emotional connection to every track. Album namesake Kill It Yourself combines desolate lyrics that contrast with angelic vocals, gentle instrumentation and ambience removing the songâ€™s harsh meaning about our disconnection from how society prepares its food. Changing up the mix, Rivers On Fire adds another dimension by including saxophone and heavy guitar riffs, which unleash the roughness of the track together with repetition of the songâ€™s title and slurred words within. Unfamiliar Ground recalls a dishevelled love story that is accompanied by minimal percussion and guitar,which leaves the lyrics to resonate wildly within. Hurry Back to Love is a standout, as Ribeiroâ€™s vocal dynamic shifts so dramatically, layered with a grungy guitar and cymbals. If You Were a Kelpie goes back to her country roots and rounds out the albumâ€™s natural happy-go-lucky feel.\r\nRibeiro collaborated with Mick Harvey on Kill It Yourself to produce an album that incorporates elements of subtle and psychedelic rock, ambience, folk and alternative country. An enlightening storytelling experience youâ€™ll want to cherish forever.\r\nRating 8.9/10\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01 The Wild.flac\r\n02 Run Rabbit Run.flac\r\n03 Hurry Back To Love.flac\r\n04 Born To Ride.flac\r\n05 Rivers On Fire.flac\r\n06 Slip The Leash.flac\r\n07 Kill It Yourself.flac\r\n08 If You Were A Kelpie.flac\r\n09 Unfamiliar Ground.flac\r\n10 Good Day.flac\r\n11 Strange Game.flac\r\n12 Hungry Ghost.flac\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCountry: USA\r\nGenre: Indie-Folk\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~700-817 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e435200c0e388531f7c35578d5c5e5f8f9ef60b","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Jess+Ribeiro+-+Kill+It+Yourself+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e435200c0e388531f7c35578d5c5e5f8f9ef60b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,67,82,0,192,227,136,83,31,124,53,87,141,92,94,95,143,158,246,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
