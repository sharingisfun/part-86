Entries are ordered by empirical formula and indexed under both name(s) and Chemical Abstracts Registry Numbers. \r\n\r\nThis two-volume compendium focuses on reactivity risks of chemicals, alone and in combination; toxicity hazards are only included for unexpected reactions giving volatile poisons.\r\n\r\n* Predict, avoid, and control reactivity danger with this latest edition of the leading guide \r\n* Covers every chemical with documented information on reactive hazards; more than 5,000 entries on single elements or compounds, and 5,000 entries on the interactions between two or more compounds \r\n* Includes five years of new reports, new references to the primary literature, and amplification to existing entries\r\n* Links similar compounds or incidents that are not obviously related","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1566deea50c10a885eb2ca1e97f1f5b9d8f2d924","amp;dn":"Bretherick%27s+Handbook+of+Reactive+Chemical+Hazards+7th+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1566deea50c10a885eb2ca1e97f1f5b9d8f2d924","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,102,222,234,80,193,10,136,94,178,202,30,151,241,245,185,216,242,217,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
