It features recent newcomers and well established acts. The musical style is varied but it fits into dark electro or electro-industrial genres.\r\n\r\nAs Halotan Records originates from Poland â€“ now based in Ireland â€“ it is only natural for us to pay close attention to what is going on in our own scene.\r\n\r\nDespite of its relatively small size, Polish dark electronic scene is dynamic and manages to consistently produce high quality bands and music. The current release of Halotan Sounds compilation marks our come back to releasing exclusively Polish compilations - our Sampler branch being the international ones. We feel that the scene has developed enough to deliver interesting music for a couple of releases a year.\r\n\r\nIt has been five years since the original (and first in Halotan Records' history) release of Halotan Sounds 1. Nobody from the original set has made it to the current one but we think it is another proof that the Polish scene is going forward and natural generation change occurs.\r\n\r\nWe strongly encourage you to familiarise yourself with this CD as it gives you an opportunity to spot very interesting music you could otherwise easily miss.\r\n\r\nThe playslist is as follows:\r\n1. GEttNER - The Former Life\r\n2. Traumatize - Moje Odbicie (Exemia Remix)\r\n3. 1unatic - Break The Machines\r\n4. Cold Therapy - The Puppeteer \r\n5. Black Tower - Zdrada\r\n6. Switchface - KrÃ³lestwo RobakÃ³w\r\n7. Orbicide - The Ashes of Ai\r\n8. Dark Side Eons - Lighthammer\r\n9. Electro Fear - Sisters\r\n10. Oira 317 - Mental Breakdown\r\n11.
