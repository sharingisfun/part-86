So now you can finally hear what they sound like I guess..\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, square-enix did not port this game using the 3D feature that the 3DS possesses.. So even though the world is rendered in 3D, it doesn't actually pop out of the 3DS screen.. It is like having the 3DS switch set to 2D mode..\r\n\r\nThis is a single .3ds file inside of a .7z archive file..\r\n\r\nYou need a gateway card or maybe some type of CFW to get this to work.. And you need a 3DS with lower version sysnand firmware..\r\n\r\nI have confirmed it to work at least with this set up:\r\nnew-3DS\r\nsysnand: 9.2.0\r\nemunand: 9.2.0\r\ngateway launcher software version 3.4.1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd62fb353657b97f17adf1d90a460bc1157d3a61","amp;dn":"%5B3DS%5D+Dragon+Quest+VIII+%5BJPN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd62fb353657b97f17adf1d90a460bc1157d3a61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,98,251,53,54,87,185,127,23,173,241,217,10,70,11,193,21,125,58,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
