For that last point, we consider flashback issues to be read a the point that the tale is being told, though issues that take place in the past are placed at that particular point in time.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91bbb654b545016d27b60da0da164c67cb0fe97e","amp;dn":"Batman+Reading+Order+-+ComicsBackIssues++-+Part+2+1992-1996","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91bbb654b545016d27b60da0da164c67cb0fe97e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,187,182,84,181,69,1,109,39,182,13,160,218,22,76,103,203,15,233,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
