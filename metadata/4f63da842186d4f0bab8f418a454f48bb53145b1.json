Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuests: Nick DiPaolo, Joe Matarese\r\n\r\nEpisode 245: Tuesday begins with Nick DiPaolo and Joe Matarese talking with Anthony about traveling to Israel, a crazy ass bus driver video from Israel, Vinnie Favorito, their love of anger, road rage, and we find out Nick has a man crush on John Denver. The guys then get into some throwback news with Harry Chapin dying in 1981, have old guy banter by shitting on the freeways, Flushing, old school newscasts, leaving shows immediately after (looking at you Nick), â€œfaggot and coffee bits,â€ inappropriate shows, Columbus Day memeâ€™s, and Howard Hughes. Gavin McInnes pops in to show off his cock ring, they discuss an old clip from the Mets and the fans, affirmative friend action, political lines, cameras, hecklers, and assholes at gigs, Bobo at Comic-Con, and Ant revisits some stories from his shitty marriage. Joe talks about his upcoming anniversary, they chat about kids (or lack thereof), threesomes, tin knocking, terrible jobs, the movie â€œSession 9,â€ mental institutions, and Nick reminisces about past jobs involving crazy folks. They take a trip down memory lane continuing with â€œpast jobs,â€ rant about food service workers with great memories, talk about tonightâ€™s debate, Anderson Cooper and Madonna, chaos in the middle east, Jesse Ventura popping into O&amp;J, Jesse Ventura and his conspiracies, and todayâ€™s show wraps talking about Jeb Bush and his staffer, young political gals, daddy issues, Ellenâ€™s hack-ass Nicki Minaj parody, Joe and Nick channeling The Sopranos, and the guys laughing about childhood shenanigans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f63da842186d4f0bab8f418a454f48bb53145b1","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-10-13+Nick+DiPaolo+Joe+Matarese+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f63da842186d4f0bab8f418a454f48bb53145b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,99,218,132,33,134,212,240,186,184,244,24,164,84,244,139,181,49,69,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
