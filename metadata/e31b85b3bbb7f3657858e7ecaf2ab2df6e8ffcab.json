This short seminar (3 hour video) is a brief expose of his work: &quot;A system to fight the system&quot;. General concepts: Canada's government as a de-facto (not legitimately authorized) government. Fundamental tricks and manipulation of language used by practitioners of the legal system to ensare the average man or woman into consenting to so-called authority.\n\nThis is will be of value to those interested in Canadian law, history and the Commercial Redemption Movement.\n\nI have converted this from .wmv format to .mp4. I'm no great expert, but it's quite viewable and listenable. The intent is to help spead the information to those who are interested.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e31b85b3bbb7f3657858e7ecaf2ab2df6e8ffcab","amp;dn":"David+Butterfield+Seminar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e31b85b3bbb7f3657858e7ecaf2ab2df6e8ffcab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,27,133,179,187,183,243,101,120,88,231,236,175,42,178,223,110,143,252,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
