Offering a truly interdisciplinary approach, the authors present both mathematical models and state-of-the-art numerical methods for adequately solving the partial differential equations involved, as well as highly practical experiments involving actual cases of ocean oil pollution. It is indispensable that different disciplines of mathematics, like analysis and numerics, together with physics, biology, fluid dynamics, environmental engineering and marine science, join forces to solve todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oil pollution problems.\n\nThe book will be of great interest to researchers and graduate students in the environmental sciences, mathematics and physics, showing the broad range of techniques needed in order to solve these pollution problems; and to practitioners working in the oil spill pollution industry, offering them a professional reference resource","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff02c69e2a18e0be7124b99fb11417cd1edee7e1","amp;dn":"Mathematical+Modelling+and+Numerical+Simulation+of+Oil+Pollution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff02c69e2a18e0be7124b99fb11417cd1edee7e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,2,198,158,42,24,224,190,113,36,185,159,177,20,23,205,30,222,231,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
