Armstrong. \r\n\r\nThese booklets were written by ministers who worked under Mr. Armstrong at \r\n\r\nAmbassador College such as but not limited to:\r\n\r\nHerman Hoeh, John Schroeder, Garner Ted Armstrong, David Jon Hill, George Johnson,\r\n\r\nand others. Also included is a nice compendium of Mr. Armstrong's worldwide \r\n\r\nministry as he faithfully served in the work of God for 53 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis torrent completes my final upload of every Herbert W. Armstrong PDF file I \r\n\r\nhave.
