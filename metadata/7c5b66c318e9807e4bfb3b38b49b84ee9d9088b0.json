To improve profits, a radical new program is introduced with the pharmacy supplying liquor- not medicine, and the nurses will practice oral sex instead of alcohol rubs. Ambulances will become traveling motels and bed making will shift into orgies. As a result of this drastic policy change, the hospital becomes financially successful while the doctors, nurses and patients reap the rewards!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5b66c318e9807e4bfb3b38b49b84ee9d9088b0","amp;dn":"Hot+Nurses+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c5b66c318e9807e4bfb3b38b49b84ee9d9088b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,91,102,195,24,233,128,126,75,251,59,56,180,155,132,238,157,144,136,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
