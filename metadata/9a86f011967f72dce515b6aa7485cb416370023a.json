Too many bands working in the sleaze/glam/hair metal world these days have at least one member who looks like an off-duty BRICKIE, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great to see a band rollinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢out the good times who look as good as they sound!\n \n\nSo, down to the important stuff Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the tracks. Well, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m here to report that when theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re good, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re absolutely TITANIC Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Down is an utterly staggerinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ slice of heavy melodic rock, choc full oÃ¢â‚¬â„¢fine, fine axework from lead guitarist Wallis, and the urgent, GnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢R swagger of The Way to Go ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t far behind, coming fully equipped with a stunning chorus that wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound outta place on a Crashdiet elpee; But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just two tracks, and with the balladic album clozer Home and the excellent rocker Caught in the Ride (which carries a set of whoah-oh-ohs straight outta the Desmond Child songbook!) they comprise the best that Damn Dice have to offer. \n\nGenre: Hard Rock / Glam Metal\nOrigin: UK\nSize/Quality: 114 mb | Mp3, CBR 320 kbps\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
