All you can tell them is that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing to worry about, that it isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t real. But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not strictly true.\n\nAs we grow up, the monsters continue to haunt us and are given names that have echoed down the centuries: Werewolves that will rip out our throats, Vampires that will suck out our blood, Frankenstein's monster whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll murder us in a dark alley. But it turns out that these familiar spine-chilling nightmares all have their origins in historical fact.\n\nNow, across three episodes, we invite you to confront the true face of horror. Combining heart stopping narrative drama with expert interviews, True Horror uncovers the inspiration behind three of our most thrilling, visceral and iconic monsters: Dracula, Frankenstein and the Werewolf. These stories will transport you to the haunted corners of our past and prove that fact is a whole lot more frightening than fiction.\n\nWerewolf:\nWe all know what to fear when the moon is full, but where did the werewolf legend come from? The villagers of 16th century Bedburg in Germany had always feared the forest that encircled them. This fear was heighened when young girls of the village started going missing. Footprints in the snow led to trails of blood. Superstitious minds wanted to believe this was the act of a wolf, or even worse, a demonic half-man, half-wolf. The villagers went looking for a beast in the woods, but the creature they were looking for was much closer to home.\n\nPart who dunnit, part inside-the-mind-of-a-monster, Werewolf: True Horror dramatises the shocking story that provided the blueprint for cinemaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s iconic werewolves.\n\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE.
