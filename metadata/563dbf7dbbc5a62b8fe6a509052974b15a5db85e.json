Twenty-eight years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:563dbf7dbbc5a62b8fe6a509052974b15a5db85e","amp;dn":"District+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"563dbf7dbbc5a62b8fe6a509052974b15a5db85e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,61,191,125,187,197,166,43,143,230,165,9,5,41,116,177,90,93,184,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
