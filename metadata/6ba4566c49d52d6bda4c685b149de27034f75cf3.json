There is (in Rappaport's own description) enough plot to choke a horse, but the real subject is how unimportant actions and events are. Everything that matters happens inside. Local Color has the ironclad logic not of life, but a dream. Everything means something. Everyone is connected to everyone else. Fantasies migrate from one person to another. Characters think each others' thoughts. They think with other people's brains, feel with each others' hearts. For Rappaport, we are all tuning forks vibrating to dog-frequencies we can't even hear. The song plays us; we dance to its rhythm even when we think we're conducting the orchestra. At the very moment we imagine ourselves to be most unique and original, we're revealed to be whistling an old familiar tune. - Ray Carney\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140336/\nRATING: 5.7/10 (5 votes)\n\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 167573946\nRuntime ...............: 1:58:07\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 212425\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD\nFrame Size ............: 720 x 480\nFPS ...................: 29.970\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1749.3\n\nAudio Codec ...........: MP3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000\nAudio bitrate .........: 128 CBR\nNo. of audio streams ..: 2\n\nNOTE: First few seconds of the opening credits were lost on my tape and there is some minor tracking glitches at the very beginning... gotta love bootlegs.
