But that history is bunk. The real pioneers of space exploration were the Soviet cosmonauts.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable feature-length documentary combines rare and unseen archive footage with interviews with the surviving cosmonauts to tell the fascinating and at times terrifying story of how the Russians led us into the space age. A particular highlight is Alexei Leonov, the man who performed the first spacewalk, explaining how he found himself trapped outside his spacecraft 500 miles above the Earth.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 7142Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrame Rate: 25p/50i\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 192Kbps CBR 48Kbps\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 89 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 4.80 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged text\r\n\r\nYou'll find instructions on how to encode it at the MVGroup site","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2db32bb83d847237bd6a8b0a637e3ebe0a8d2d33","amp;dn":"Cosmonauts.How.Russia.Won.the.Space.Race.1080i.HDTV.h264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2db32bb83d847237bd6a8b0a637e3ebe0a8d2d33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,179,43,184,61,132,114,55,189,106,139,10,99,126,62,190,10,141,45,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
