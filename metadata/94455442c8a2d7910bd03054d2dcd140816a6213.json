Comeau (Nova Science, 2011).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN: 978-1-61209-896-8\r\n\r\nIn the development of food engineering, one of the many challenges is to employ modern tools and knowledge to develop new products and processes. Simultaneously, improving quality, safety, and security remain critical issues in food engineering. Additionally, process control and automation regularly appear among the top priorities identified in food engineering. This book presents topical research in the study of food engineering, including tempering, polymorphism and fat crystallisation during industrial chocolate manufacture; trends in high pressure processing of foods; stability of dried foods; food packaging and predictive modelling of thermal properties of foods","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94455442c8a2d7910bd03054d2dcd140816a6213","amp;dn":"New+Topics+in+Food+Engineering+%28Food+Science+and+Technology%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94455442c8a2d7910bd03054d2dcd140816a6213","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,69,84,66,200,162,215,145,11,208,48,84,210,220,209,64,129,106,98,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
