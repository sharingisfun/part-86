IF IT DOESNT GO TO CYDIA AND SEARCH FOR OPENSSH AND INSTALL IT. \nALSO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A WIRELESS NETWORK YOU CAN CONNECT TO AND THAT YOUR IPHONE/IPOD TOUCH AND YOUR PC IS\nCONNECTED TO THE SAME WIRELESS NETWORK.\n\n\n1.

Once connected click on the blue arrow icon next to the network your connected to.\n\n6. Keep now of the IP address your connected to.\n\n7.

Now you need to find the Magellan app folder and since the folders are named letters and numbers it might be\ndifficult to find it. So the easiest way to find it is at the top of the window click changed so that it organizes\nthe folders by date and if your last app you added was the Magellan app then it will be the top folder.\n\n17. Now that you are in the folder you will see ''Roademate.app''folder click that and go into the folder.\n\n18. Now look for ''Info.plist'' select that and delete it.\n\n19. Now on the left window go to the directory of where you downloaded my torrent file and drag my modified \n''Info.plist'' into the left window in the ''Roadmate/app'' folder/\n\n20. Thats It enjoy.\n\n\nIf anyone wants to donate for my time and effort you can do so at my PayPal email at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8cf8ebefe0e9ede8e9fecce1ffe2a2efe3e1a2&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nAlso I want to make a site but I only know the basics of html and php.
