Pat Donohue is a master of fingerstyle jazz guitar. He describes in detail his arrangements as well as how to improvise upon the tunes.\n\nIn the first lesson of Classic Jazz for Fingerstyle Guitar, Pat presents three great Jazz compositions: Stormy Weather, St. Louis Blues and You Rascal You. Archival footage is included that features Duke Ellington performing Stormy Weather with Ivie Anderson from1943; Bessie Smith singing St. Louis Blues from a rare 1929 film short and Louis Armstrong in 1942 doing You Rascal You.\n\nImg: http://www.guitarvideos.com/prodlarge/942coloradscan.jpg\n\nYoutube clib","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac3c9540247a224ca8566e9f38dcc6cc4bf776d0","amp;dn":"pat+donohue+-+Jazz+clasics+vol+1.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac3c9540247a224ca8566e9f38dcc6cc4bf776d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,60,149,64,36,122,34,76,168,86,110,159,56,220,198,204,75,247,118,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
