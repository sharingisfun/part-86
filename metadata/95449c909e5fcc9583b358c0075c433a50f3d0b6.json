But we are not alone - we suffer a constant stream of unwanted visitors. Our houses, our food, our belongings, our very existence are under constant attack from a host of invaders eager to take advantage of our shelter, our food stores and our tasty soft furnishings.\n\nFrom bats in the belfry to beetles in the cellar, moths in the wardrobe and mosquitoes in the bedroom, humans cannot escape the attentions of the animal kingdom. Nature may be red in tooth and claw, but when it's our blood the bedbugs are after, when it's our cereal bowl that's littered with mouse droppings, and when it's our favorite chair that collapses due to woodworm in the legs, it really brings it home the fact that we and our homes are part of nature too.\n\nThis book represents a 21st century version of the classic Medieval bestiary. It poses questions such as where these animals came from, can we live with them, can we get rid of them, and should we? Written in Richard Jones's engaging style and with a funky-retro design, House Guests, House Pests will be a book to treasure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95449c909e5fcc9583b358c0075c433a50f3d0b6","amp;dn":"House+Guests%2C+House+Pests+-+1st+Edition+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95449c909e5fcc9583b358c0075c433a50f3d0b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,68,156,144,158,95,204,149,131,179,88,192,7,92,67,58,80,243,208,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
