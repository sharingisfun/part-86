Hastily seeking to rectify \nhis predicament, the youth begins scouring an abandoned \nmilitary dump and runs across a strange looking machine \nwith a large crystal orb. He has no idea that it \nbelonged to a shot down alien space craft and that it \ncontains not only the power to generate time warps, it \ncan also destroy the world. If he did, he might not \nhave turned it on. Unfortunately, he does activate it \nand sends his entire class back in time. The special \neffects are especially notable, as the kids roam Earth \nfrom the dawn of time, to the future.\n\n\nAn oldie but still remembered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6e68d20fb5a3ec1111e1bd404a0ba1b13fbf9dd","amp;dn":"My.Science.Project.%5B1985%5D.DvDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6e68d20fb5a3ec1111e1bd404a0ba1b13fbf9dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,230,141,32,251,90,62,193,17,30,27,212,4,160,186,27,19,251,249,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
