Not only did they ban me twice, for no good reason, they also banned the original uploader of this great show! Nice one. Great way to run a community! I just want others to be able to enjoy this show.\n\nThis series cannot be purchased and only exists on VHS rips. Sadly, this is as good as it gets. Thus it is not exactly being 'pirated', but preserved.\n\nTorrent contents:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nComedyNation-reseed/\n351M comedynation1.avi\n6.3K ComedyNation1.nfo\n351M comedynation2.avi\n6.2K ComedyNation2.nfo\n351M comedynation3.avi\n6.2K ComedyNation3.nfo\n176M comedynation4.avi\n8.2K ComedyNation4.nfo\n350M comedynation5.avi\n8.0K ComedyNation5.nfo\n\nInfo from the original uploader:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTorrent 1 comment: I have found, so far, 4 episodes of this show that broadcast in 1998. This is the only full episode. I can upload the others if requested.\n\nTorrent 2 comment: This second episode misses the first five minutes.\n\nTorrent 3 comment: This third episode misses the last five minutes.\n\nTorrent 4 comment: This fourth episode only has the first 11 and a half minutes.  However it does include a hilarious sketch on 'scientologee' from mighty boosh's Rich Fulcher (Bob Fossil). I have found another full episode that I will upload next.\n\nTorrent 5 comment: This fifth episode is COMPLETE.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAired: BBC-2 at Friday 12:15 AM (30 min.)\n\nStatus: Ended    Premiered: January 9, 1998    Last Aired: December 11, 1998\n\nShow Categories: Variety Shows, Comedy\n\nBritish sketch comedy show\n\n\nComments from IMDB:\n\n\n\nI can understand why many people would be bewildered and possibly almost frightened by this sort of comedy; it was raw and it was completely uncompromising.\n\n\n\nComedy Nation was a platform for new talent to break into television, it was a very jumbled sketch show with many writers and performers adding pieces; it was completely un-linked and totally unrefined. Yes there were some dodgy pieces, but there was also a great deal of genius on show; it seems everybody currently producing alternative British television comedy had a part in this show and it served very well as a stepping stone for some of the best acts on TV. The likes of Kevin Eldon, Julia Davis, Peter Serafinowicz, David Mitchell, Robert Webb and Johnny Vegas; to name a few.\n\n\n\nThe most acessible character from COMEDY NATION is Bulla played by Ricky Grover . Bulla is based upon a real life British prisoner called Charles Bronsan who`s widely regarded as the hardest man in the British penal system. Bulla`s catch phrase &quot; I`m a lovely guy but I get a little bit naughty &quot; did become something of a cult item in the late 1990s.\n\n\n\nComedy Nation contained the kind of sketches that left you stunned; The Divine David, a kind of beat up, bitter transvestite, Simon Munnery's 'league against tedium', and of course, the Gaa Haa clown, the embodiment of insanity. I suppose you either like it or you don't, but if you don't, I think you're really missing out.\n\n\n\nCast List from IMDB:\n\n\n\nSeries Cast\n\n\tFiona Allen\t... \tVarious Roles (3 episodes, 1998)\n\n\n\n\tSacha Baron Cohen\t... \tVarious (3 episodes, 1998)\n\n\n\n\tRonni Ancona\t... \tVarious roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\n\n\tJames Bachman\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tJilly Bond\t... \tVarious roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tBarry Castagnola\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tJames Chandler\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\n\n\tSean Cullen\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tJulia Davis\t... \tVarious roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tKevin Eldon\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tAlan Francis\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tSimon Godley\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tRicky Grover\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tJames Holmes\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tMelanie Hudson\t... \tVarious roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tMartin Hyder\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tGeorge Jeffrie\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tGillian Jesson\t... \tVarious roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tPhill Jupitus\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tLes Keen\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tDave Lamb\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tAndy Linden\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tSimon Lipson\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tJo Martin\t... \tVarious roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\n\n\tCarla MendonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§a\t... \tVarious roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tDavid Mitchell\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\n\n\tBen Moor\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tVanita Nichols\t... \tVarious roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tTracy-Ann Oberman\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tMark Oswin\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tChris Pavlo\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tVicki Pepperdine\t... \tVarious roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tSally Phillips\t... \tVarious roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tMichael Redmond\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tSalliya\t... \tMs Herman (unknown episodes)\n\n\tSarllya\t... \tMrs. Herman (unknown episodes)\n\n\tJamie Sefton\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\n\n\tPeter Serafinowicz\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tGordon Souther\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tJohn Sparkes\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tGail Tinsley\t... \tVarious roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tMark Tonderai\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tHarry Towb\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tPaul Tylack\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tBert Tyler-Moore\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tKim Wall\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\tRobert Webb\t... \tVarious Roles (unknown episodes)\n\n\n\nHowever the don't mention Peter Kay who plays a put upon teenager with an overbearing northern mum, and music from Julian Barratt and Tim Hope as Techno Counter Culturists 'The Pod' with definite boosh-like references.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aef23936430aaad5033dd0539d7db1925a1bc7e2","amp;dn":"Comedy+Nation+%281998%29+reseed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aef23936430aaad5033dd0539d7db1925a1bc7e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,242,57,54,67,10,170,213,3,61,208,83,157,125,177,146,90,27,199,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
