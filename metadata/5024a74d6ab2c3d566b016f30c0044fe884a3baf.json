There is also a cricket-mad grandad building a mini pavilion in his garden, with the 1950s-inspired build incorporating bats, bails and even a boundary rope alongside an ingenious bunk bed that with the pull of a chord transforms into a sofa. George's German road trip reaches Berlin, and a house situated where the Wall once stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 01-Oct-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5024a74d6ab2c3d566b016f30c0044fe884a3baf","amp;dn":"George+Clarkes+Amazing+Spaces+S05E03+480p.HDTV.x264-RMTeam.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5024a74d6ab2c3d566b016f30c0044fe884a3baf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,36,167,77,106,178,195,213,102,176,22,243,12,0,68,254,136,74,59,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
