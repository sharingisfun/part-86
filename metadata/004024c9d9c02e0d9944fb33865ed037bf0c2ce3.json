It is largely a tale of incompetence and misplaced priorities, as an informant had made it perfectly clear in advance that the attack was coming. Most chilling of all is the last scene of the film, where terrorist bombmaker Ramzi Yousef is being flown back to the United States to face trial, and his helicopter flies over the World Trade Center. Looking down with grim determination, he vows ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNext time, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll bring them both down.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nOf course, four years after this film was made came the events of September 11th, 2001. A few folks at that time dimly remembered that there had been a movie about this on HBO a few years back. HBO, for whatever reason, has never since 9/11 shown this movie again, and has only just finally released it on DVD.\n\nCast\n\nPeter Gallagher\t... \tJohn Anticev\nArt Malik\t... \tRamzi Ahmed Yousef\nNed Eisenberg\t... \tEmad Salem\nMarcia Gay Harden\t... \tNancy Floyd\nAndreas Katsulas\t... \tSheik Omar Abdel-Rahman\nPaul Guilfoyle\t... \tLou Napoli\nMike Starr\t... \tMahmud Abouhalima\nShaun Toub\t... \tEl Sayyid Nosair\nTony Gillan\t... \tMohammed Salameh\nShiek Mahmud-Bey\t... \tRodney Hampton-El (as Sheik Mahmud-Bey)\nJoe Zaloom\t... \tIbrahim El-Gabrowny\nKeith Smith\t... \tRay Williams\nJeffrey DeMunn\t... \tRobert Brokaw\nAllison Janney\t... \tAssistant District Attorney\nMike O'Malley\t... \tStorage facility manager \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_World_Trade_Center_bombing&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe 1993 World Trade Center bombing occurred on February 26, 1993, when a car bomb was detonated below the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. The 1,500 lb (680 kg) urea nitrateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“hydrogen gas enhanced device[1] was intended to knock the North Tower (Tower One) into the South Tower (Tower Two), bringing both towers down and killing thousands of people. It failed to do so, but did kill six people and injured 1,042.\n\nThe attack was planned by a group of conspirators including Ramzi Yousef, Mahmud Abouhalima, Mohammad Salameh, Nidal Ayyad, Abdul Rahman Yasin and Ahmad Ajaj. They received financing from Khaled Shaikh Mohammed, Yousef's uncle. In March 1994, four men were convicted of carrying out the bombing: Abouhalima, Ajaj, Ayyad and Salameh. The charges included conspiracy, explosive destruction of property and interstate transportation of explosives. In November 1997, two more were convicted: Yousef, the mastermind behind the bombings, and Eyad Ismoil, who drove the truck carrying the bomb.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004024c9d9c02e0d9944fb33865ed037bf0c2ce3","amp;dn":"HBO+1997+Drama+-++Path++to++Paradise+NTSC+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004024c9d9c02e0d9944fb33865ed037bf0c2ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,64,36,201,217,192,46,13,153,68,251,51,134,94,208,55,191,12,44,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
