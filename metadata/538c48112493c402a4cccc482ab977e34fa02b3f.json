Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuest: Nick DiPaolo\r\n\r\nEpisode 236: Mondayâ€™s TACS begins with a recap of the blood moon, NASAâ€™s news about water on Mars, Anthony offers up a Matt Damon conspiracy theory, and talks about seeing Nick DiPaolo over the weekend and doing Periscope karaoke. Ant rants about the EAS and his FiOS issues, talks about the doc â€œDrunk Stoned Brilliant Dead,â€ National Lampoon, Brian Reganâ€™s new special, and Nick DiPaolo calls in to talk about his show over the weekend, going off on crowds, drinking and flowing on stage, being true to comedy, and the guys discuss loud talkers. Ant geeks out over Star Trek Continues, goes back in time with the classic â€œcake stompâ€ video, brings up Jocktober, plays a â€œHarry the Haterâ€ video, talks about acceptance, â€œowning it,â€ and Tex Antoine. We watch a Howard Stern tribute video, hear about Bubba the Love Sponge tampering, see Danny Pintauro on Oprah, watch a throwback commercial with Babs, Ant channels his inner Babs, and a few callers chime in. Ants gives us a rundown of whoâ€™ll be on the show this week, talks freak shows, ugly women, George Zimmermanâ€™s tweet, Carly Fiorinaâ€™s stage â€œcollapsing,â€ a drill team brawl, rapey kiss cams, a caller recommends a â€œtrolling pornâ€ video, and the show wraps with Pope chat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:538c48112493c402a4cccc482ab977e34fa02b3f","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-09-28+Nick+DiPaolo+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"538c48112493c402a4cccc482ab977e34fa02b3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,140,72,17,36,147,196,2,164,204,204,72,42,185,119,227,79,160,43,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
