When a new product called &quot;The Stuff&quot; begins \neating into the market share of traditional frozen desserts, the dairy \nindustry hires former FBI agent Moe Rutherford (Michael Moriarty) to \ninvestigate the competition. With the assistance of deposed ice-cream \nmagnate Chocolate Chip Charlie (Garrett Morris), Rutherford discovers that \nthe substance is actually a sentient entity that takes over its victims \nminds while eating away at their bodies from the inside. Meanwhile, young \nJason (Scott Bloom) realizes that his family's strange behaviour has something \nto do with the dessert product in their refrigerator that refuses to stay in \nits carton, and he launches a campaign to destroy the threatening confection. \nSoon Rutherford and Jason must team up with Nicole Kendall (Andrea Marcovicci) \nThe Stuff's unwitting advertising mastermind, and Vietnam vet-turned-militia \nleader Colonel Spears (Paul Sorvino) to save America from its own sweet tooth. \nSorvino and Moriarty would go on to co-star in NBC's hit police procedural, \nLaw &amp; Order. Icy-eyed As the World Turns hunk Brian Bloom appears alongside \nhis brother, Scott Bloom. The Stuff's television connections also extend to \ncameos from Clara Peller, pitchwoman for the Wendy's Where's the beef? \ncampaign, and Abe Vigoda of Barney Miller fame. Actresses Brooke Adams, Tammy \nGrimes, and Laurene Landon also appear in parodic commercials for the titular \ndessert.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Michael Moriarty.\n=&gt;-Andrea Marcovicci.\n=&gt;-Garrett Morris.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Larry Cohen.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Comedy : Horror : Sci-Fi.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1985.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.22 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 027 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 26 mn.\n=&gt;-The Stuff 1985.............: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090094/\n=&gt;-The Stuff 1985.............: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stuff/\n=&gt;-The Stuff 1985.............: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-stuff-1985/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1 280 x 688.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 910 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 171 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f587f057a490de1e3fe98d622cd423c777a99dfe","amp;dn":"The+Stuff+-+Larry+Cohen+Horror+1985+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH246-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f587f057a490de1e3fe98d622cd423c777a99dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,135,240,87,164,144,222,30,63,233,141,98,44,212,35,199,119,169,157,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
