Safety with Machinery provides a basic grounding in machinery safety and covers safeguarding philosophy and strategy, typical hazards, risk assessment and reduction, guarding techniques, ergonomic considerations, safe use of equipment and plant layout. All types of safeguards are discussed â€“ mechanical, interlocking, electrical / electronic / programmable, hydraulic, pneumatic.\r\n\r\nThe new edition has been updated throughout in line with changes in regulations and standards. The section on electric, electronic and programmable safety systems has been expanded to reflect their increasing importance. The book now focuses on the harmonised standards (e.g. EN ISO 13849, IEC/EN 61131-2) which can be used by manufacturers to self-certify their machines for the European market without the need for third party examination, but also covers other relevant standards (e.g. IEC 62061). Many practical examples set the regulations in context and assist in the interpretation of the various standards.\r\n\r\nSafety with Machinery is essential reading for all engineers involved in machinery design and maintenance all over the world as every machine sold within or into the EU needs to conform to the harmonised standards. It also provides health and safety professionals, students and employee representatives, as well as certification bodies, health and safety inspectors and safety regulators with a comprehensive overview of machinery safety","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a72c1410a216a8c00cf777f22ca49e32cb5a41e4","amp;dn":"Safety+with+Machinery+2nd+-+John+Ridley+and+Dick+Pearce","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a72c1410a216a8c00cf777f22ca49e32cb5a41e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,44,20,16,162,22,168,192,12,247,119,242,44,164,158,50,203,90,65,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
