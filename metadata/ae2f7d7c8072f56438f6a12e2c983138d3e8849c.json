Book #1.\n\nWhen old fart blogger Mormon Silver goes to interview young entrepreneur Bea Plastique, he encounters a woman who is stunning, smart, and scary. The unsophisticated, horny Silver is startled to realize he wants this woman (from behind, mostly) and, despite her mysterious love of ice hockey, finds he is desperate to get close to her (and honk her boobies). Unable to resist Silver's oral skills, silver chin fur, and argyle socks, Plastique admits she wants him, too--but on her own terms.\n\nStunned yet delighted by Plastique's kinkiness, Silver hesitates. For all of her success--her multinational assortment of lubricants, her gay assistant, her condo on a high floor (I mean, really high--you're almost above the clouds, for Christ's sake)--Plastique is a woman haunted by her past and consumed by the need to have hockey-related sex. When the couple embarks on a bold, twisted physical affair, Mormon discovers Bea Plastique's secrets (including a naughty uncle) and explores his own icky, sticky desires.\n\nSilly, sexy, and deeply disturbing, Fifty Shades of Silver Hair and Socks is a tale that will make you horny, tickle you, and give you some great ideas to try on an unsuspecting lover.\n\nFifty Shades Shadier (Fifty Shades of Silver Series Book 2)\nA parody. Book #2.\n\nFrightened by the wacky desires and twisted history of the gorgeous, boob-a-licious, young mogul, Bea Plastique, Mormon Silver has ignored all warning signs, and asked for her hand in marriage.\n\nDesire for Bea's butt still dominates his dreams, and when she proposes a route there, Mormon cannot resist. They continue their sweltering sexcapades, and Mormon learns more about the disturbing past of his hungry, obsessed, and insatiable lover.\n\nWhile Bea wrestles with her sex toys, Mormon must deal with the fury and cock-blockage of her Grandmother, who came before her (of course), and make the second most important decision of his life--whether or not to reveal that he has had a vasectomy.\n\nFifty Shades Effed (Fifty Shades of Silver Series Book 3)\nA parody. Book #3. \n\nWhen silver-chinned blogger, Mormon Silver, first met the horny and hungry young entrepreneur, Beatrice Plastique, it ignited a boff-fest that left mattress stains and sore hineys. Frightened, curious, and still hardened by BeaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twisted erotic tastes, Mormon struggles to keep up. Determined to match her raging sexual desire, he turns to ED medicine and adult toys. \n\nNow, Bea and Mormon have it all: syrup, toe-curling orgasms, and a world of freaky kinkery ahead. But, Mormon knows that peeling her away from her evil grandmother and douchie ex, Chris, will pose challenges he could never expect. Mormon must somehow learn to participate in BeaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fetishes without serious injury. And, Bea must overcome her desire to hip-check Mormon into the third row of an skating rink and screw him senseless. \n\nJust when it seems all is well, their murmuring together will cause bystanders to point and say ew, banks will threaten foreclosure, and a single blog post will determine their fate.\n\nAbout the Author\nPhil Torcivia is a bestselling author of humorous books and parodies. He lives in San Diego and is admittedly one relationship disaster away from a third cat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae2f7d7c8072f56438f6a12e2c983138d3e8849c","amp;dn":"Fifty+Shades+Trilogy+-+Phil+Torcivia+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae2f7d7c8072f56438f6a12e2c983138d3e8849c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,47,125,124,128,114,245,100,56,246,161,46,44,152,49,56,211,232,132,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
