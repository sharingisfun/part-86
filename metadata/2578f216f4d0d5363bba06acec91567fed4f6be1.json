The game is based on the significantly improved Mount &amp; Blade: Warband engine.\r\n'Caribbean!' lets you decide your own role and create your own adventure.\r\nThose who crave for battles in jungles, raids on rich cities and capturing enemy ships can choose the path of a pirate and a mercenary who will raise to the top with the help of his own sword.\r\nThose who aren't afraid of the words 'financial planning' can take pleasure in making great deals and expanding their business by choosing the path of a merchant and a business man. Rank and wealth can be achieved any way you like.\r\nOf course, if you're tired of fighting and boarding enemy ships, you can always invest your collected savings in good real estate. Or do it the other way around â€” sell all of your manufactures, buy a nice brig and become a pirate.\r\nNaval battles with controllable ships and boarding fights.\r\nBuilding and management of commercial property in towns.\r\nDetailed crew and fleet management.\r\nRanking progression system for military and business options.\r\nAdvanced order and control system for armies in land battles.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10,\r\nProcessor: Intel Core Duo 2.0 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 X2 3600+; \r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM;\r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GTX 295 or AMD HD 4870; \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c; Hard Drive: 2 GB available space; \r\nSound Card: Direct X-compatible sound card; \r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2578f216f4d0d5363bba06acec91567fed4f6be1","amp;dn":"Caribbean%21+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2578f216f4d0d5363bba06acec91567fed4f6be1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,120,242,22,244,208,213,54,59,186,6,172,236,145,86,127,237,79,107,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
