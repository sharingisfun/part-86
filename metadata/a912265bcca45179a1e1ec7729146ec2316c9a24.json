Norman Taurog won the Academy Award for directing and his nephew, Jackie Cooper, was nominated for best actor. (Lionel Barrymore won.)\r\n\r\nThis copy appears to have been captured from a TV broadcast, so it's been reformatted for TV and has scan lines, static, and artifacts. Also, the print the TV station was using had streaks and specks. Thereâ€™s even hum in the audio. Sorry about all this, I hope somebody can come up with a better copy. Still, this one exists, and it's all here","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a912265bcca45179a1e1ec7729146ec2316c9a24","amp;dn":"Skippy%281931%29.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a912265bcca45179a1e1ec7729146ec2316c9a24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,18,38,91,204,164,81,121,161,225,236,119,41,20,110,194,49,108,154,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
