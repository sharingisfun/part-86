Click link below for Guide to help setting up OS, MPC-HC &amp; LAV Filters for\r\n    Bit Streaming to HD-Receiver &amp; MAD VR, as well!\r\n  http://www.avsforum.com/forum/26-home-theater-computers/1357375-advanced-mpc-hc-setup-guide.html\r\n \r\n 2. So how can I watch your not cropped x264 rip in the so-called 2.35:1 \r\n    Anamorphic/Letterbox image, mate?\r\n\r\n For starters we have Film Aspect Ratio = Letterbox, CinemaScope, PanaVision etc. =\r\n 2.35:1, 1.85:1, 1.66:1, 1.33:1 ect. Film Aspect Ratio is the ratio of the width\r\n of the visible area of the video/film frame to the height of the visible area,\r\n measuring from a 4:3 TV Display. All the Cinematic Aspect Ratios/Framings\r\n mentioned just above apply to the HD resolutions 1080p (NOT 800p) and 720p (NOT\r\n 544p) and to the standard resolutions as well, being the DVD resolutions 720x576p\r\n (PAL) &amp; 640x480p (NTSC).\r\n\r\n Then we have the &quot;black bars&quot;. These areas are black to allow for better\r\n contrast. The wrongly called &quot;black bars&quot; is in fact part of the image! So if any\r\n part of the black unused areas is cropped/cut of the image then the original\r\n aspect/scope/letterbox ratio is lost! That goes for all BD/DVD resolutions.\r\n\r\n I know that a Blu-Ray player cannot playback anamorphic/letterbox material like\r\n the DVD player can, but the anamorphic/letterbox/Framing/Aspect Ratio scope is\r\n still in the transfer/encode, so for this to work you have to rip the Blu-Ray\r\n disc to PC, and play it back anamorphic/letterbox from PC. Or you can grab one of\r\n Grym's uncropped x264 rips and use that for anamorphic/letterbox playback from PC.\r\n\r\n You can set a DVD player &amp; also HD Box's to Display Aspect Ratio setting 4:3 and\r\n receive correct aspect ratio/framing (Not all HD Box's apply). All the 16:9\r\n setting in a DVD &amp; Blu-Ray player or HD Box do, is to crop the image. That's it. \r\n\r\n You can watch the movie in original 2.35:1 anamorphic/letterbox scope,\r\n like you do in the theater, by setting the aspect ratio in your software player\r\n to 2.35:1.\r\n \r\n Example: \r\n\r\n Open a 2.35:1 Grym mkv encode or retail BD 2.35:1 m2ts file in MPC-HC. Right\r\n click in center of MPC-HC screen. Choose 'Video Frame'. Choose 'Override Aspect\r\n Ratio'. Choose '235:100' (2.35:1). Display Aspect Ratio setting on your 16:9 flat\r\n screen you set to 1:1 pixel mapping or whatever the name is on your telly. On my\r\n own Pioneer Kuro LX5090H 16:9 flat TV it's called Dot by Dot. Now play mkv. \r\n \r\n Ok, now try using same playback procedure with a cropped so-called &quot;2.35:1&quot;\r\n 1920x800 rip/file. 1920x800 cannot be 2.35:1 on a tv screen (Where it Counts),\r\n because The Cinematic Aspect Ratios has nothing to do with Resolution! Aspect\r\n Ratio is a Framing tool for images in the cinema business. So it's impossible to\r\n get a correct 2.35:1 framed image on a correct set tv screen when the resolution\r\n is cropped to 1920x800, because now the image has been manipulated to a 1.85:1\r\n framing simply because part of the black areas are cropped of.\r\n\r\n If you want to watch 1.85:1 aspect ratio movies in the correct aspect ratio\r\n you then set the aspect ratio to 2.35:1 as well, and the image will have the\r\n &quot;small&quot; black bars.\r\n\r\n Cinematic Aspect Ratios on 16:9 flat TV: Display Aspect Ratio setting on TV set\r\n to 1:1 pixel mapping and resolution is 1080p. Resolution could also be 720p, 480p\r\n or 576p, the Framing/Aspect Ratio would be the same:\r\n\r\n 1.33:1 - Black bars on all sides of image (4:3) - Aka 1.37:1 Academy Standard\r\n          Image:  http://someimage.com/rLrxESc\r\n \r\n 1.66:1 - Black bars on all sides of image (Small L+R) - Movies\r\n          Image:  http://someimage.com/1ck9wcT\r\n\r\n 1.78:1 - Full screen. Image fills whole of screen (16:9) - HDTV &amp; Home Video\r\n          Image:  http://someimage.com/BqgDoMB\r\n \r\n 1.85:1 - Black bars Top &amp; Bottom of image (Small) - Movies, HDTV &amp; Home Video\r\n          Image:  http://someimage.com/90ZxXoJ\r\n\r\n 2.35:1 - Black bars Top &amp; Bottom of image (Big) - Aka 2.40:1 &amp; Anamorphic Scope \r\n          Image:  http://someimage.com/ll7hnDY\r\n\r\n 2.35:1 on a theater screen:  http://someimage.com/aopL0DM\r\n \r\n Links: \r\n  \r\n  http://www.widescreen.org/index.shtml\r\n \r\n  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterboxing_(filming)\r\n\r\n \r\n                                    (-G-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:478de154d8d3a34790baa5fbf2add3147aec08da","amp;dn":"Haunting.of.Cellblock.11.2014.Bluray.1080p.DTS-HD-HR.x264-Grym","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"478de154d8d3a34790baa5fbf2add3147aec08da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,141,225,84,216,211,163,71,144,186,165,251,242,173,211,20,122,236,8,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
