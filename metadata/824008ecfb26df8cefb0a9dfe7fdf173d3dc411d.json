But, the fifth estate has uncovered the Canadian connection to that collapse, in House of Cards.\n\nHis name: Brian Chisick. A Grade 10 dropout from Vancouver who moved to California, Chisick pioneered a predatory type of lending there. He made his first fortune preying on borrowers with hidden upfront fees and sky-high interest rates. Wall Street behemoths like Lehman Brothers bankrolled Chisick and learned that they could sell bad loans to millions of people. This inspired a pandemic of self-delusion and excess that brought on an economic crisis unmatched since the Great Depression, 80 years ago.\n\nHouse of Cards is also the story of one of Wall StreetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmasters of the universeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Lehman BrothersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ chairman and CEO Richard Fuld. Once an icon of rugged capitalism, Fuld eventually became a symbol of vanity and greed. His companyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lending practices would eventually cause the collapse of the storied financial institution Lehman Brothers. In its ruins lay the reputations of the proud and powerful and, more significantly, the lives of millions of ordinary people who put their trust, and their life savings, in Lehman Brothers.\n\nAbout the collapse of Lehman Brothers, one interview subject says: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be talking about it for a hundred years. It was the day capitalism changed.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 349 MiB for 45mn 0s 936ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : HDTV\nLanguage          : English CA\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 944 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 336 (1.857) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:824008ecfb26df8cefb0a9dfe7fdf173d3dc411d","amp;dn":"CBC.the+fifth+estate.S19E10.HDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"824008ecfb26df8cefb0a9dfe7fdf173d3dc411d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,64,8,236,251,38,223,140,239,176,169,223,231,253,241,115,211,220,65,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
