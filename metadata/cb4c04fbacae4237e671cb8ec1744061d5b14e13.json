The block was shown weekly on Friday nights from June 11, 1999 through February 23, 2007. It was created by Steve Patrick and Christina Augustinos, and produced by Primal Screen.\n\nEach week on CCF, a different Cartoon Cartoon character would host; the hosting segments were often re-used throughout the block's run. While the block was primarily for Cartoon Cartoons, it later integrated non-Cartoon Cartoons such as Samurai Jack, Justice League, and What's New, Scooby-Doo?. In 2003, CCF was rebooted in a live-action format as &quot;Fridays&quot;, hosted by Tommy Snider, Nzinga Blake (2003Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2004), and Tara Sands (2005Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2007). It aired series outside the &quot;Cartoon Cartoon&quot; sub-brand, and also included skits, guest stars, and live musical performances.\n\nFridays was replaced with Friday Night Premiere Thunder in 2007. Until June 2007, Friday night was the only evening that was programmed for children on the network from 10:00 P.M. to 6:00 A.M., with Adult Swim originally airing on SaturdayÃ¢â‚¬â€œThursday nights (before moving to seven nights a week in July 2007)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb4c04fbacae4237e671cb8ec1744061d5b14e13","amp;dn":"Cartoon+Cartoon+Fridays+2000+Dexter+Hosts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb4c04fbacae4237e671cb8ec1744061d5b14e13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,76,4,251,172,174,66,55,230,113,203,142,193,116,64,97,213,177,78,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
