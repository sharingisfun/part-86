Formed in 1997, they consist of Isam Bachiri (born in Denmark and of Moroccan background), Waqas Ali Qadri (born in Denmark and of Pakistani background), and Lenny Martinez (born in Honduras and is of Cuban and Honduran descent). All three members are devoutly religious, Isam and Waqas being Muslims, and Lenny being Catholic. The band members live in BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸ndby Strand.\n\nSound of a Rebel, Outlandish's fourth major production, was released on May 11 2009. The 1st single released from Sound of a Rebel was Rock All Day. Two of the three band members have also released their own solo albums (in Danish).\n\nThe album is a departure from earlier work in many respects. The religious and social content has been all but toned down, and the album features two collaborations with female vocalists, a first for the group.\n\nOutlandish did their first U.S. tour in Summer 2008 with the &quot;Voices for Change&quot; tour hosted by the Muslim American Society - Youth. Venues included New York, Tampa, Chicago, Detroit, Dallas, and Los Angeles. The message that the tour promoted is the following:\n\n&quot;We need to stake OUR claim on entertainment, as people striving for MORALITY: We are demanding entertainment with a message like Outlandish who bring it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a moral message! Outlandish will be headlining MAS Youth's Voices For Change in their first United States tour.\n\nThe band have recently helped form the umbrella organization, Music With Meaning, that aims to bring together like-minded artists in order to promote and produce inspirational and meaningful music. Its motto is &quot;If you stand for nothing, you will fall for anything.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72bb6f0adb927ccfbcc2943f77992d1a6a11e0cb","amp;dn":"Outlandish+-+Rock+All+Day++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72bb6f0adb927ccfbcc2943f77992d1a6a11e0cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,187,111,10,219,146,124,207,188,194,148,63,119,153,45,26,106,17,224,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
