Emeric Pressburger\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050707/\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrival of workmen on a small Soho street has unexpected implications for the daughter of an Italian family about to emigrate to Canada.\r\n\r\nOriginally titled &quot;The Miracle in St Anthony's Lane&quot;, the screenplay for this playful slice of poetic realism was written by Emeric Pressburger in 1934. Despite constant re-selling during the 1930s, the script sat in the writer's touting suitcase until 22 years later, when its production marked the beginning of Pressburger's final split with Michael Powell. As such, Miracle in Soho occupies an odd position in the history of British cinema, of interest because of the history of its author, but regarded a failure for the same reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 512x384, 25.000 fps, 1251 Kbps, 01h34m22s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 224 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip in TV aspect ratio, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/4jseeyn0z/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/6n6j4etdr/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/xq8stkapr/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/nz6vpumv3/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/xz1s5qy4f/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbd9c4712c590ff3f0269b80eccc12230ffac71f","amp;dn":"Miracle+in+Soho+%281957+-+United+Kingdom%29+drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbd9c4712c590ff3f0269b80eccc12230ffac71f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,217,196,113,44,89,15,243,240,38,155,128,236,204,18,35,15,250,199,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
