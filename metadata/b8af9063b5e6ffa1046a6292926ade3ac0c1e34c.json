Ward\n\nWorld events are rapidly catching up with the prophecies made by Nostradamas\nthree hundred years ago. Whether his predictions were accidental or based upon\nan occult foreknowledge, they are frequently uncanny in their accuracy.\nHis book of oracles is having a tremendous vogue at present, partly because of\nwide variety of interpretations that can be made from his prognostications, but mainly\nbecause it makes fascinating reading when related to catastrophes announced daily while\nthe world is in crisis.\nThis edition edited by Charles A. Ward gives special emphasis to prophecies of contemporary\nevents and those immediately ahead.\n\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8af9063b5e6ffa1046a6292926ade3ac0c1e34c","amp;dn":"Oracles+of+Nostradamas+-+Charles+A.+Ward+%5BEN+PDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8af9063b5e6ffa1046a6292926ade3ac0c1e34c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,175,144,99,181,230,255,161,4,106,98,146,146,106,222,58,192,193,227,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
