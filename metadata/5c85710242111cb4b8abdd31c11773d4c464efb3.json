The main purpose of their existance was to rip the piss out of Craig Thornton, otherwise known as AB (Arrogant Bastard). The classic track &quot;The Gone Song&quot; reflects upon some of Craig's more difficult times, in particular his tragic split from partner Ashley who soon realised that she was clearly way out of his league and went off to shag Max instead.
