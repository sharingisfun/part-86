It combines the ease-of-use of the Arduino platform, with the power of a 400 MHz Atheros AR9331 Wi-Fi system-on-chip (WiSOC) that runs Linux.\n\nBut if you are not experienced and confident in working with Linux-based operating systems, it may be difficult for you to use the YÃƒÂºn to its full potential.\n\nBob Hammell is the author of popular Arduino learning resources, such as Connecting Arduino: Programming and Networking with the Ethernet Shield. In this book, he guides you through all of the Arduino YÃƒÂºnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s features and explains how to make use of this unique board","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc5003d737fcc77b3ff397848639c8d8fb192b3d","amp;dn":"Arduino+Meets+Linux%3A+The+User%27s+Guide+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc5003d737fcc77b3ff397848639c8d8fb192b3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,80,3,215,55,252,199,123,63,243,151,132,134,57,200,216,251,25,43,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
