The artistic legacy of the Romans also survives in many other forms, and in this book Susan Walker focuses on four main themes--the heritage of Greece, portraiture, public art, and furnishing and decorating homes. From the early Republic through to the later Empire the taste for Greek culture was an important influence on the Romans, but one which they adapted to create an art uniquely theirs. Drawing on the magnificent collections of the British Museum, Dr Walker discusses a wide range of Roman antiquities, from monumental sculpture for public places, portraits of emperors and private citizens, to mosaics, wall-paintings and tableware for enjoyment in more intimate surroundings","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d65954c48cec939b3a04ccfc9b8b2376587a1568","amp;dn":"Roman+Art+From+the+British+Museum+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d65954c48cec939b3a04ccfc9b8b2376587a1568","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,89,84,196,140,236,147,155,58,4,204,252,155,139,35,118,88,122,21,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
