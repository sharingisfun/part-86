As they leave a bar, their car is hit by an SUV full of tough-looking Albanians, who intimidate them into not retaliating.\r\n\r\nJustin attempts to pitch a video game about policemen but the idea is rudely dismissed by his boss. Later, Ryan convinces him to use the police uniforms from his presentation as costumes for their college reunion party. Upon attending, they meet many successful former classmates and both are confronted with a sense of failure and they mutually accept to honor their pact. As they walk home, they are treated like real cops and decide to enjoy the gag. It allows Justin to finally get the attention of Josie, a waitress to whom he is attracted and who works at a local diner, Georgie's.\r\n\r\nRyan decides to take the hoax further than one night. He learns official procedures on YouTube and buys a used police cruiser, modifying it with decals to resemble a real LAPD car. Although reluctant, Justin agrees to continue the charade, and through it begins a relationship with Josie. Ryan gets revenge on the Albanians who hit his car, unaware they are actually mobsters blackmailing the owner of Georgieâ€™s. During their many shenanigans, Ryan and Justin end up on a real distress call with Patrol Officer Segars. The experience shakes Justin, who realizes they face serious jail time if exposed. He tries to â€œretire,â€ but gets a phone call from Josie about a man frequently harassing her at work. It turns out to be Mossi Kasic, leader of the Albanian mobsters. Once more, the pair are intimidated into doing nothing.\r\n\r\nVia Segars, Ryan obtains surveillance equipment to gather evidence and put Mossi away, along with an unidentified partner who has been investigating the pair. Ryan convinces Justin to do an undercover operation to obtain information on an incriminating shipment of crates. During the mission, they discover the crates full of SWAT equipment and weapons, along with secret tunnels that run between Mossi's club and Georgieâ€™s restaurant. This necessitates the acquisition of the restaurant, explaining the blackmail. After a few close encounters with the mobsters, they barely escape. Fed up, Justin insists on mailing the evidence anonymously, but Ryan, finding purpose in his life again, is set on delivering it personally. They fight, and part ways.\r\n\r\nRyan brings his evidence to Segars, who recommends it go to the highest authority, which is Detective Brolin. Unfortunately, Brolin is actually Mossi's business partner. After instantly recognizing each other, Ryan makes it out of the station, but his sudden threat has blown their cover. Meanwhile, Justin decides to &quot;man up&quot; and, in uniform, assertively pitches his game again. One of Brolin's officers shows up to try and kill him, inadvertently helping to sell the pitch. Ryan is abducted, and Mossi sends a threatening message to Justin. Overwhelmed, Justin pleas to Segars for help after admitting everything. He also confesses to Josie that he is not a real cop, which he had made previous attempts to do, and she disgustedly leaves him.\r\n\r\nJustin goes into the tunnels alone while Ryan pits Mossi and Brolin against each other, prompting Mossi to shoot and kill the detective. Justin attempts to save his friend, but is overpowered. Segars arrives, causing Mossi and his crew to retreat. Segars admonishes the duo for their deception and orders them to leave before going after the mobsters, without waiting for backup. Ryan and Justin agree they canâ€™t abandon him, and suit up with the SWAT equipment. They save Segars, but he becomes incapacitated. The pair then face Mossi alone, during which the two reconcile. They fail to take him out, but luckily, Segars is able to show up and shoots Mossi in the back of the chest, saving Justin and Ryan.\r\n\r\nThanks to the respective confidence and motivation gained during their impersonations, Justin has become a successful game developer, while Ryan graduates from the police academy as a true, fully-fledged member of the LAPD. Justin apologizes to Josie, and after she forgives him, they rekindle their relationship. Ryan, however, still has not given up on their fun as cops together, and convinces Justin to don the fake uniform once again and join him on patrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Info\r\n\r\n\r\nCompression: No\r\nMovie Quality: DVD9\r\nSize: 6688Mb\r\nLanguages: English, French, German, Italian Ac3 5.1, Commentary by Greenfield/Nicholas Thomas\r\nSubtitles: English, French, Dutch, German, Italian, Arabic, Turkish\r\nColors\r\nRuntime: 100 min.\r\nMenu:Yes\r\nExtra: Brothers in Blue, Gallery, Theatrical trailer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c6ab28fe25d3d866a40a6eb0f4d71a1374c56c","amp;dn":"Let%27s+Be+Cops+-+Bastardi+in+Divisa+%282014%29+%5BDVD9+-+MultiLang+5.1+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c6ab28fe25d3d866a40a6eb0f4d71a1374c56c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,198,171,40,254,37,211,216,102,164,10,110,176,244,215,26,19,116,197,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
