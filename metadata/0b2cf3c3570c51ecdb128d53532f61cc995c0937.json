Make a wrong move at Forest Ridge Mall, and you'll have to answer to no-nonsense security head Ronnie \nBarnhardt (Rogen). Ronnie sees skateboarders as the blight of society, and any shoplifter unfortunate enough to summon his wrath will be promptly \nbusted and booked. Sure, Ronnie may suffer delusions of grandeur when it comes to his job, but perhaps with a little effort he'll eventually \nget to trade in his flashlight and patch for a gun and a badge. When a flasher begins tormenting the shoppers at Forest Ridge Mall, Ronnie seizes \nthe opportunity to showcase his detective skills and impress gorgeous makeup counter girl Brandi (Anna Faris), who can't be bothered to \ngive him a second glance. Perhapsby catching the culprit, Ronnie will finally earn himself a prized position over at the police academy.\n But the one thing Ronnie hadn't counted on was competition, and when Detective Harrison (Ray Liotta) of the Conway Police makes it \nhis personal mission to nab the flasher, the two rivals begin working around the clock to crack the case before their counterpart\n\n\n                                       M P A A  R A T I N G  * * * \n\n\t           Rated R for pervasive language, graphic nudity, drug use, sexual content and violence\n\t                  \n                                 R E T A I L   R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\t\t\t\t\t10/04/2009\n                               \n                         T O R R E N T   R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\t\t\t\t\t01/15/10\n\n                           \n\n\t\t\t\tD V D  C o n t e n t  * * * \n  \n        Main Movie ******: Original Movie UNTOUCHED, UNRATED AND RATED VERSIONS.\n         * Video -3215 Kbps - 5 Passes - Widescreen ORIGINAL FILM\n         Video: Enchanced Widescreen Letterbox for 16x9 TV\n       Audio: Dolby Digital w/ sub-woofer channel\n             Dolby Surround (4.0)\n       Language: English, French, Spanish\n       Subtitles: French, Spanish\n\n\n\n        Menu ************:\n         * Yes\n        DVD Menu\n        \n    \n\n        Extras/Special Features **********:\n         None on Original Disk\n        Removed **********:\n      Trailers, warnings, adverts\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b2cf3c3570c51ecdb128d53532f61cc995c0937","amp;dn":"Observe+and+Report+%5BNTSC%5D+%5BWS%5D+2009+ENG+SP+FR+%5BCLWILSON1977","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b2cf3c3570c51ecdb128d53532f61cc995c0937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,44,243,195,87,12,81,236,219,18,141,83,83,47,97,204,153,92,9,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
