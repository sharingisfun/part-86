Black\n        Saturday. On this  day the worst  bushfires in the  history of\n        Australia caused devastation  across Victoria like  never seen\n        before. The effect this terrible tragedy had was felt not only\n        here,  but  worldwide.  Almost  simultaneously  Queensland was\n        undergoing  its  own  tragedy,  with  the  state  experiencing\n        widespread flooding.\n\n        In response to our  nation's greatest ever natural  disasters,\n        Australia's music  community, along  with some  of the biggest\n        music names internationally,  banded together for  two stadium\n        benefit concerts that ran simultaneously in both Melbourne and\n        Sydney under the unified banner SOUND RELIEF. The final result\n        of over $8.00 million  raised is an achievement  that everyone\n        should be proud of.\n\n        It is fitting that such a tremendous event can be immortalised\n        on DVD and the generosity  of the artists involved must  again\n        be acknowledged and commended. Thanks should also be given  to\n        all the individuals and companies that contributed their  time\n        and resources to make Sound Relief such a resounding  success.\n        After 4  long months  of clearing  the project,  every artist,\n        record  label  and  publisher  have  donated  100%  of   their\n        royalties and all profits from the sale of this DVD will go to\n        fund Red Cross  Disaster Preparedness Projects,  which develop\n        programs  and  resources  to  better  prepare  communities for\n        disasters such  as Bushfires  and Floods.  9 hours  of footage\n        over 4 discs. featuring every artist, documenting the  biggest\n        concerts in Australian music history.\n \n \n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n \n\n    Contains A Selection Of The Following Tracks From The Sydney SCG Concert:\n    DISC 1\n    * Coldplay - Yello\n    * Coldplay - You're The Voice Featuring John Farnham\n    * Coldplay - Fix You\n    * Hoodoo Guru - Tojo\n    * Hoodoo Guru - The Right Time\n    * Hoodoo Guru - Whats My Scene\n    * Little Birdy - Come On Come On\n    * Little Birdy - Six Months In A Leaky Boat\n    * Little Birdy - Brother\n    * Little Birdy - Beautiful To Me\n    * Architecture In Helsinki - Hold Music\n    * Architecture In Helsinki - Do The Whirlwind\n    * Architecture In Helsinki - Heart It Races\n    * Architecture In Helsinki - That Beep\n    * You Am I - Piano Up The Tree\n    * Josh Pyke - Lines On The Palms\n    * Josh Pyke - The Summer\n    * Josh Pyke - Make You Happy\n    * Josh Pyke - Don't Wanna Let You Down\n    * Josh Pyke - Middle Of The Hill\n    * Josh Pyke - Memories And Dust\n    * Marcia Hines - Fire And Rain\n    * Taylor Swift - You Belong With Me\n    * Taylor Swift - Our Song\n    * Taylor Swift - Change\n \n \n     \n                                           \n                   RIP NOTES                     \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n \n \n                                    Enjoy!\n \n \n \n     \n                                           \n               GROUP INFORMATION                 \n        9 Years of the Force and still         \n                     going strong                      \n     \n \n        What we are looking for:\n\n        * gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n        * 100mbit or gigabit archive sites for TV/XVID/ETC.\n        * 1080p or 720p rippers pre retail or classics\n        * Fios cappers in u.s\n        * U.K or Pre Retail Dvdrippers\n        * Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage   \n        * If you think you can help contact us on irc,\n          or email us on &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d99fb6abbabc99b1acaab1f7b8b0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff3f4d2f7d6440ed3c1fabff6f76cd84aef2c44","amp;dn":"Sound.Relief.SCG.2009.DISC.1.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eff3f4d2f7d6440ed3c1fabff6f76cd84aef2c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,243,244,210,247,214,68,14,211,193,250,191,246,247,108,216,74,239,44,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
