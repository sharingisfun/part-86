The band's first, and most well-known album, &quot;U.S.A. For M.O.D.&quot; was produced by Scott Ian (also of S.O.D.) and featured a number of songs originally meant for S.O.D. Milano has kept the band going on and off over the years, and is the only musician featured on every release. In recent years, he has joked that M.O.D. stands for &quot;Milano's On Drugs&quot;.\r\n\r\n[b]Method Of Destruction â€Žâ€“ U.S.A.
