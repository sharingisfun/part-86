It includes all four of their Fallen music videos, an hour of behind the scenes features, and a recording of a concert at Le ZÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nith in Paris. It also includes a previously unreleased song on the CD, titled &quot;Missing&quot; (which also plays during the DVD credits); while placed at the end of the disc, the CD insert shows it as track eight however it is actually track 14 and incorrectly labeled whisper.\n\nA secret performance of &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; in Las Vegas, Nevada can be found on the DVD's main menu by moving the cursor to the largest thorn on the left-hand side of the screen. The band symbol then becomes visible. When selected, this will take you to the hidden footage.\n\nEvanescence","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15b63a0ce31731913db03d952ac8c989b27fe34a","amp;dn":"Evanescence+Going+Under","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15b63a0ce31731913db03d952ac8c989b27fe34a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,182,58,12,227,23,49,145,61,176,61,149,42,200,201,137,178,127,227,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
