All the world's computers are infected. Everything from cars to payment systems and, of course, computers and smart phones stop functioning, and with them go essential functions including emergency services, transportation, and the food supply. Billions may die.\n\nBut evolution never stops. The virus continues to evolve, developing intelligence, communication, and finally an entire civilization. Some may be friendly to humans, but others are not.\n\nLeon and his companions must race against time and the military to find a way to either befriend or eliminate the virus race and restore the world's computer infrastructure.\n\n\n\nRead by J.
