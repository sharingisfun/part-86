And on top of that, they have to train their bodies to face the harshest conditions known to man, pull a sled behind them weighing almost 170lbs, escape deadly crevasses, stuff their bodies with over 6,000 calories a day, and ski for up to 18 hours a day.\n\nHave they got what it takes to win the race?\n\n279 min approx.\n\nVideo; x264; 720*572 (16:9); 1818 kbps; 25.000 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz\nSubtitles: English (soft)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc681bc1905b1bbc4dbce62c1931b61d947bfb0c","amp;dn":"On+Thin+Ice+-+The+Challenge+of+a+Lifetime+2009+DVDRip+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc681bc1905b1bbc4dbce62c1931b61d947bfb0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,104,27,193,144,91,27,188,77,188,230,44,25,49,182,29,148,123,251,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
