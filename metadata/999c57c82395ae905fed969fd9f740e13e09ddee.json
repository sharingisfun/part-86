The screenplay by David Cook is adapted from his own novel. The cast is impressive, including William Hurt, Keith Allen, Jane Horrocks, Prunella Scales, Nerys Hughes, John Hurt and featuring a remarkable dÃƒÂ©but from the young Chris Cleary Miles.\n\nHowever, it is not commercially available, never having been released on DVD. It's unclear as to why, but it may be that some of the themes concerning the relationship between lonely single postmaster Graham and the disturbed young boy James are considered too controversial for modern audiences.\n\nThe version in this torrent was recorded on VHS from television in the mid '90s. It has a couple of rough cuts where the adverts have been edited out but has otherwise survived remarkably well.\n\nIt is distributed under the auspices of Ã¢â‚¬Å“fair use for artistic and educational purposes.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe mpeg file was encoded with OpenShot video editor using non-proprietary codecs. IT WILL NOT PLAY ON WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER. There should be no problem with most cross-platform media players, such as VLC player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:999c57c82395ae905fed969fd9f740e13e09ddee","amp;dn":"Second+Best+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"999c57c82395ae905fed969fd9f740e13e09ddee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,156,87,200,35,149,174,144,95,237,150,159,217,247,64,225,62,9,221,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
