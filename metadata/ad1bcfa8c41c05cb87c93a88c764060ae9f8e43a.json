Before long the dealership is flourishing and Ready's crew are kings \nof the roost, but what happens when the man who made his mint by hustling cars meets the one woman who isn't charmed by his formidable \nskills as a salesman. Realizing this may be his one shot at true love, Ready starts working overtime to convince the woman of his dreams \nthat he's the best bargain on the lot. Has the hustler finally found his soul, or is he so locked into his anything-goes lifestyle that \nthere's no looking back? Ving Rhames, Ed Helms, James Brolin, and David Koechner co-star.\n\n\n\n                                       M P A A  R A T I N G  * * * \n\n\t           Rated R for sexual content, nudity, pervasive language and some drug material\n\t                  \n                                 R E T A I L   R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\t\t\t\t\t12/15/2009\n\n                               \n                         T O R R E N T   R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\t\t\t\t\t01/15/10\n\n                           \n\n\t\t\t\tD V D  C o n t e n t  * * * \n  \n        Main Movie ******: \n         * Video -3215 Kbps - 5 Passes - Widescreen \n         Video: Enchanced Widescreen Letterbox for 16x9 TV\n       Audio: Dolby Digital w/ sub-woofer channel\n             Dolby Surround (4.0)\n       Language: English, French, Spanish\n       Subtitles: French, Spanish\n\n\n\n        Menu ************:\n         * Yes\n        DVD Menu\n        \n    \n\n        Extras/Special Features **********:\n         None on Original Disk\n        Removed **********:\n      Trailers, warnings, adverts\n\n\n        Chapters ********:\n\nDisc #1 -- Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard\n1.
