But he is saved from desperation by reading an autobiographical book and meeting its author, a deaf and blind lady of his own age. 2)Fatty, a security guard in his fifties, lives for two things : good food and love for a pretty executive living in his block of flats. But, if it is easy to satisfy his first need winning the heart of the distant belle is a horse of another color. 3)Two teenage schoolgirls get to know each other on the Internet. Soon they fall in love. (Film Movement series Year 4, Film 9)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24552e8d8c33092c100c073cc51c5309c4633e64","amp;dn":"Be+With+Me+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24552e8d8c33092c100c073cc51c5309c4633e64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,85,46,141,140,51,9,44,16,12,7,60,197,28,83,9,196,99,62,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
