One serious injury can stop the growth of your business in its tracks. Management of Hazardous Energy: Deactivation, De-Energization, Isolation, and Lockout provides the practical tools needed to assess hazardous energy in equipment, machines, and systems, and covers how to manage hazardous energy through elimination or control in order to ensure worker safety and regulatory compliance.\r\n\r\nWritten in plain English with a minimum of jargon, this book provides safety professionals with the knowledge they need to interact with specialists, designers, and engineers to ensure that appropriate and necessary protocols and safety practices and tools are put into place for assessing the dangers and steps taken to eliminate or control exposure to hazardous energy when needed. Approaching the subject from the bottom up, the author starts at the workplace level, to ensure that the right actions happen for the right reasons.\r\n\r\nThe book explains a protocol for describing the flow of energy, including transformation and/or storage; for capturing the logic of decisions about control, including failure analysis and contingency planning; and ultimately for creating procedures that are technically sound and defensible. Creating simple procedures for ensuring worker safety and regulatory compliance, the book offers US and international strategies for hazardous energy management and contains examples to illustrate the application of concepts to specific areas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcbc0d9cdbd35bb9e99789c9bc3782f6274d8ea5","amp;dn":"Management+of+Hazardous+Energy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcbc0d9cdbd35bb9e99789c9bc3782f6274d8ea5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,188,13,156,219,211,91,185,233,151,137,201,188,55,130,246,39,77,142,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
