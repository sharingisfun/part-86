Encouraging viewers to interrogate a diverse range of images and sounds sampled from 100 years of cinema, Fear Itself informs and unnerves in equal measure, changing the way you watch horror movies for good.\r\n\r\nDirector Charlie Lyne says: â€œI got about 20 minutes into the first feature-length commission from BBC iPlayer, Adam Curtisâ€™s Bitter Lake, before I started fidgeting with excitement about what an incredible platform it had become for weird and wonderful art - art that wouldnâ€™t quite fit anywhere else. About a month later I somehow found myself beginning work on Fear Itself, the second feature-length commission from BBC iPlayer. No pressure then.\r\n\r\n&quot;The last six months have been a whirlwind of experimentation, discovery and occasional terror, attempting to make a film that both evokes and scrutinises the effects of horror cinema at the same time. Iâ€™m thrilled (and more than a little anxious) to be releasing the film into the wilds of the internet, where it can finally be scrutinised in its own right.â€\r\n\r\nThe film is narrated by Amy E. Watson, an actor living in Glasgow and born in Canada. She grew up watching horror films and has worked with Charlie on shaping the character of the narrator","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e930db468d0d5a8a05ef57abe3dee96659a8fdfb","amp;dn":"Fear.Itself.2015.tt4573906.EN.SUB.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e930db468d0d5a8a05ef57abe3dee96659a8fdfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,48,219,70,141,13,90,138,5,239,87,171,227,222,233,102,89,168,253,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
