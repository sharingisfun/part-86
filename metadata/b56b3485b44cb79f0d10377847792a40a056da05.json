The album was released on the Columbia Legacy CK 61513 label on 16 July 2002.\nThe performance is noteworthy in that it was the first official live release by Simon and Garfunkel recorded in the 1960s. Recorded in 1967 prior to the duo's work on the soundtrack to The Graduate. It features many of the duo's early hits and album tracks, such as &quot;Leaves That Are Green&quot;, &quot;He Was My Brother&quot;, and &quot;For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her&quot;.\nFour of the songs from the album were previously released on 1997's Old Friends box-set. However, one track from that set, &quot;Red Rubber Ball,&quot; was not included in this release, thus leaving it somewhat incomplete.\nIn contrast to the duo's other official live releases (The Concert in Central Park, Old Friends: Live on Stage, and Live 1969), this recording features Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel performing alone. It should also be noted that this album does not capture the same show as the bootleg Live from New York City, 1966&quot;, despite similar material and packaging","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b56b3485b44cb79f0d10377847792a40a056da05","amp;dn":"Simon+%26amp%3B+Garfunkel+-+Live+from+New+York+City+1967+%5BFlac%5D%5BTNT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b56b3485b44cb79f0d10377847792a40a056da05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,107,52,133,180,76,183,159,13,16,55,120,71,121,42,64,160,86,218,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
