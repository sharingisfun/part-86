Much of the negative criticism was that people would not know if this was secure. I have decided to release the source code here so anyone can both verify its integrity and improve the utility for the good of everyone. Many people have also noted it would be easier to just run WUSA /UNINSTALL /KB:3035583 in a command prompt or batch file, or just uninstall the GWX update through the Control Panel, and while I understand that this is much easier, I decided to make this utility for the average user to be able to just run it without the hassle of the command prompt or selecting the proper update to uninstall in the Control Panel.\r\n\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\n\r\n* Just Run to use...\r\n\r\n*Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a215c169ada22c33af7476927ebb2ac44544d99c","amp;dn":"I+Don%26rsquo%3Bt+Want+Windows+10+4.0+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a215c169ada22c33af7476927ebb2ac44544d99c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,21,193,105,173,162,44,51,175,116,118,146,126,187,42,196,69,68,217,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
