Anthony then talks about Back to the Future, chewing gum, goes through some of a list of rewatchable movies, bullies Rat for #SpiritDay, and we hear from a few callers. Comedian Des Bishop joins the show to talk about his debut at Carolineâ€™s, his popularity around the country, Guinness, moving to Ireland as a child, Irish teens, Catholic rules, Irish Americans vs. Irelands, learning Mandarin Chinese, and censorship by society. The guys then chat about pushing the envelope, humor varying by location, tone in a different language, misconceptions about China, the Mets, Des talks about doing the Wilbur Theatre, getting recognized by Chinese people, and doing a dating show in China. TACS then takes it to the streets where Des cuts it up with the Chinese, he then comes back in studio where they end the show talking about culture clashes, prostate exams, getting a finger, testicular cancer, shaving your balls, shaving your snatch, Asian hair, the music scene in China, Ladyboy, weird shit in Japan, capitalism, propaganda, Desâ€™s Chinese girlfriend, and the fear of embarrassment.\r\n\r\nBonus Episode 248: TACS at New York Comic Con - Ant interviews Bruce Campbell, Lucy Lawless and more!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:251ba43db9c37151e02d2922f982a774b430aba4","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-10-15+Des+Bishop+NYCC+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"251ba43db9c37151e02d2922f982a774b430aba4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,27,164,61,185,195,113,81,224,45,41,34,249,130,167,116,180,48,171,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
