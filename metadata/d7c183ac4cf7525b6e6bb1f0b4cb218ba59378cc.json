Joe Sestak (D-PA) calls in at 6:05am Pacific to talk about Martha Coakley, his Senate race, and health care reform.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI) calls in at 8:05am Pacific to talk about whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s next for health care reform in the wake of the vote in Massachusetts.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Workers are carving out mass graves on a hillside north of HaitiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s capital, using earth-movers to bury 10,000 earthquake victims in a single day while relief workers warn the death toll could increase. Medical clinics have 12-day patient backlogs, untreated injuries are festering and makeshift camps housing thousands of survivors could foster disease, experts said.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The White House has begun focusing greater attention on economic issues, including unemployment persisting near 10 percent, government expansion, Wall Street excesses and federal deficits. Officials said Wednesday that that shift will intensify now in the wake of TuesdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Senate election of Scott Brown in the Democratic stronghold of MA.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Shorn by MA voters of their pivotal 60th Senate vote and much of their political momentum, the White House and congressional leaders are considering a more modest version of health care reform. It could focus on curbing insurance company practices like denying coverage to sick people and on helping low-earning people and small businesses afford coverage, officials said.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ President Obama will announce today that he wants new federal government powers to limit the size and complexity of large financial institutions and to limit their ability to engage in high-risk trades.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7c183ac4cf7525b6e6bb1f0b4cb218ba59378cc","amp;dn":"The+Stephanie+Miller+Show+-+Jan+21+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7c183ac4cf7525b6e6bb1f0b4cb218ba59378cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,193,131,172,76,247,82,91,110,107,177,240,180,203,33,139,165,147,120,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
