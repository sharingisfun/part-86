Songs start with Ira Kaplan's repetitive (and very simple) chord changes, as Georgia Hubley and (at this juncture) regular bassist James McNew add layer after layer of supportive sound. On a noisier track like the aforementioned &quot;Mushroom Cloud of Hiss,&quot; the song explodes in paroxysms of feedback and drops the rhythmic pulse altogether, eventually returning the backbeat after a few minutes of white noise. That may not be everybody's cup of tea, but for those who like this type of adventurousness and recklessness, it's a lot of fun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdd4b8df58ffff64594e3f546ebc04bec6e64ef7","amp;dn":"Yo+La+Tengo+-+May+I+Sing+with+Me+%281992%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdd4b8df58ffff64594e3f546ebc04bec6e64ef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,212,184,223,88,255,255,100,89,78,63,84,110,188,4,190,198,230,78,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
