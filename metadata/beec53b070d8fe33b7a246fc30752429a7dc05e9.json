The songs here were not chart hits in the U.S., but were popular in the U.K., where clubs devoted to soul music continue to thrive. \nMarlena Shaw's excellent &quot;Wade in the Water&quot; shows that she wasn't restricted to jazz recordings, and Billy Stewart surprises with the funky rendition of the blues standard &quot;Everyday (I Have the Blues).&quot; As if they weren't potent enough by themselves, Sugar Pie Desanto and Etta James team up for &quot;In the Basement&quot; and ask you to &quot;stop and check yourself&quot; on &quot;Do I Make Myself Clear.&quot; \nIt's also nice to see lesser-known names make stellar appearances here, like the Knight Brothers -- best known for their 1965 ballad &quot;Temptation 'Bout to Get Me&quot; -- turn in a Memphis burner with &quot;That'll Get It,&quot; while Chicago staple Bobby McClure proves he knows what he wants with the pulsing &quot;Peak of Love.&quot; \nA thoroughly consistent selection that makes for a fine downtown diversion when the uptown gloss and polish of Motown seems too genteel.
