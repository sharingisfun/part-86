It was written by Alun Owen and originally released by United Artists. The film portrays several days in the lives of the group.\n\nThe film was a financial and critical success. Time magazine rated it as one of the all-time great 100 films.[3] British critic Leslie Halliwell described it as a &quot;comic fantasia with music; an enormous commercial success with the director trying every cinematic gag in the book&quot; and awarded it a full four stars.[4] The film is credited as being one of the most influential musical films of all time, inspiring numerous spy films, The Monkees' television show and pop music videos.\n\nPlot\n\nBound for a London show, the Beatles escape a horde of fans. Once they are aboard the train and trying to relax, various interruptions test their patience: after a dalliance with a female passenger, Paul's grandfather is confined to the guard's van and the four lads join him there to keep him company. John, Paul, George, and Ringo play a card game, entertaining schoolgirls before arriving at their destination.\n\nUpon arrival in London, the Beatles are driven to a hotel, only to feel trapped inside. After a night out during which Paul's grandfather causes minor trouble at a casino, the group is taken to the theatre where their performance is to be televised. The preparations are lengthy so Ringo decides to spend some time alone reading a book. Paul's grandfather, a &quot;villain, a real mixer&quot;, convinces him to go outside to experience life rather than reading books. Ringo goes off by himself. He tries to have a quiet drink in a pub, walks alongside a canal and rides a bicycle along a railway station platform.[5] Meanwhile, the rest of the band frantically (and unsuccessfully) attempts to find Ringo. Finally, he returns after being arrested by the police along with Paul's grandfather, and the concert goes ahead as planned. After the concert, the band is taken away from the hordes of fans via helicopter.[6]\nCast\n\n    John Lennon as Himself\n    Paul McCartney as Himself\n    George Harrison as Himself\n    Ringo Starr as Himself\n    Wilfrid Brambell as John McCartney, Paul's grandfather\n    Norman Rossington as Norm, The Beatles' manager\n    John Junkin as Shake, The Beatles' road manager\n    Victor Spinetti as the TV director\n    Richard Vernon as Johnson, the gentleman on the train\n    Anna Quayle as Millie\n    Alison Seebohm as Dolly, Simon Marshall's secretary\n    Kenneth Haigh (uncredited) as Simon Marshall\n    Julian Holloway (uncredited) as Adrian, Simon's assistant\n    Robin Ray as the TV floor manager\n    Lionel Blair as the TV choreographer\n    David Janson as Charley, a young boy Ringo encounters\n    John Bluthal (uncredited) as a car thief\n    Edward Malin as the hotel waiter\n    Deryck Guyler as a police sergeant\n    Michael Trubshawe (uncredited) as the casino manager\n    Margaret Nolan (uncredited) as a girl at the casino\n    Pattie Boyd (uncredited) as Jean, a blonde schoolgirl on the train\n    Prudence Bury (uncredited) as Rita, a brunette schoolgirl on the train\n    Phil Collins (uncredited) as a schoolboy watching the Beatles' TV performance\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Day's_Night_%28film%29\n***************************************************\n__________________________________________________\n\nIf you like this sample, buy the DVD and seed\n__________________________________________________\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 676x480 (267:160) 23.976fps [V: h264 main L4.0, yuv420p, 676x480 [default]]\nAudio: AAC 48000Hz stereo [A: Stereo [eng] (aac lc, 48000 Hz, stereo) [default]]\n****************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a20c61377b6307caca9399cc01c5a58b9c19b189","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+A+Hard+day%27s+Night+%28film%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a20c61377b6307caca9399cc01c5a58b9c19b189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,12,97,55,123,99,7,202,202,147,153,204,1,197,165,139,156,25,177,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
