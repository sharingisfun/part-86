As part of this candid exploration into Larkin's life, Wilson confronts the allegations of racism, bigotry and misogyny that emerged following the publication of his Selected Letters and authorised biography, and which dogged his posthumous reputation.\r\n\r\nHowever, Wilson concludes that it is Larkin's poems, not his faults, that have survived. Featuring readings of his work by Larkin himself, including the greatness of The Whitsun Weddings, Arundel Tomb, Church Going and Aubade, Wilson argues that Larkin spoke for Britain between the 1950s and 1970s perhaps more than any other writer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bc1c30a49fbc530a9e98801e69dce91e2c11415","amp;dn":".Larkinland.EN.SUB.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bc1c30a49fbc530a9e98801e69dce91e2c11415","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,193,195,10,73,251,197,48,169,233,136,1,230,157,206,145,226,193,20,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
