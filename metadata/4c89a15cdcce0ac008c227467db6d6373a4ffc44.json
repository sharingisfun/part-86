We will start from the very beginning by making a list of desktop items, and then weâ€™ll create every single item one by one, using Adobe Illustrator basic shapes and effects and adding details and textures. Then we will create a true-to-life wooden background for the desk and finish up by building a well-balanced composition of our workspace items, adding flat-style long shadows and some text to give our template a finished look. By the end of this course youâ€™ll be able to create a wide variety of different designs, combining existing elements and adding new ones, using the tips and tricks youâ€™ve learned during this course","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c89a15cdcce0ac008c227467db6d6373a4ffc44","amp;dn":"TutsPlus+-+Creating+Flat+Workspace+Elements+for+Advertisements","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c89a15cdcce0ac008c227467db6d6373a4ffc44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,137,161,92,220,206,10,192,8,194,39,70,125,182,214,55,58,79,252,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
