Installing and running these on your local machine gets messy fast. Data from your app can also interfere with other apps you are developing on the same system. With Vagrant you can isolate these dependencies in a virtual machine, start and stop them at the same time, and prevent yourself and others from having to set up everything again when your system crashes or when you move to a new computer. In this course, you will learn how to create a virtual machine with Vagrant, configure it for Rails development and share it with others","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd971e5f84dc867e97606d715996a285b970d963","amp;dn":"TutsPlus+-+Easy+Rails+Development+Environment+With+Vagrant","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd971e5f84dc867e97606d715996a285b970d963","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,151,30,95,132,220,134,126,151,96,109,113,89,150,162,133,185,112,217,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
