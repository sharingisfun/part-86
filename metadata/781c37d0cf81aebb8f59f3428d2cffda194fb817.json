It is free of charge for private non-commercial, educational use and non-profit organisations. It is popular with users as it provides many features normally found in commercial image viewers and it supports many image file formats that other powerful image organizers such as ACDSee do not.\nAlso, XnView has been able to support an increasing number of file formats (mainly image file formats). It can read more than 400 image file formats, some audio and video file formats, and write 50 image file formats. XnView also supports ICC profiles in JPEG, PNG and TIFF files.\n\nXnView can show IPTC, Exif and XMP metadata, and write IPTC metadata (but cannot do batch writing of IPTC metadata, and some users are longing for the batch IPTC editing function). A further limitation is that it currently does not allow to sort thumbnails within a folder by a user-defined order.\n\nXnView can search files that have the same filename or data, and can search for similar graphics as well.\n\nIn addition, the display of the histogram of a picture is possible. And within a few mouse clicks, scripts can be created to convert, manipulate and rename a batch of images in one go.\n\nSeveral image editing tools are included, for instance color and size manipulation, several filters and effects (full version even includes HarryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Filters 3.0). Lossless (without new encoding) turning, flipping and cropping of JPEG files is supported. Creation of advanced slide shows is also possible. Furthermore, it can upload images to an FTP site or ImageShack, burn images to a CD or DVD (Nero Burning ROM required) with a few clicks (full version only).\n\n\nimage\n\n\n* Just Run to use...\n\n* Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:781c37d0cf81aebb8f59f3428d2cffda194fb817","amp;dn":"XnViewMP+0.75+32%26amp%3B64+Bit+%2B+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"781c37d0cf81aebb8f59f3428d2cffda194fb817","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,28,55,208,207,129,174,187,143,89,243,66,141,44,255,218,25,79,184,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
