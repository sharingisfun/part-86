While on a train the morning after, he sees high school student Nanoka Kohinata looking at a button and crying. As she's later getting off the train, she drops her wallet and Koshiro follows to return it. Koshiro finds himself watching her sudden smile as she notices the cherry blossoms are in bloom. Later, Koshiro is leaving his job at a marriage-arranging company with a coworker when he encounters the girl again. Having two free tickets to a nearby amusement park, he gives them to her. To his surprise she asks him to go with her. While on the Ferris wheel, the girl explains that she was crying on the train because she'd been rejected by a boy she'd loved for several years. Koshiro ends up telling her about his own break up, and cries while she comforts him","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e5691e9e206d7a7b1169bfec82a898b86e29403","amp;dn":"Koi+Kaze+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e5691e9e206d7a7b1169bfec82a898b86e29403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,86,145,233,226,6,215,167,177,22,155,254,200,42,137,139,134,226,148,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
