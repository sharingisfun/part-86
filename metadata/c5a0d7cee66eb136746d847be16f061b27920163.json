Priest and trainee exorcist Merrily Watkins is asked by the police for her help in solving a baffling and gruesome murder.\r\n\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/09/24/5603d1eaddedf27084c264c9b1a25cce.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nMerrilyâ€™s newly acquired training has put her on the dark side of the pulpit. She has become one of the few women clergy working in the area of deliverance ministry  â€“  a  job considered important by the modern church and operating in every diocese but rarely publicised due to the confidential nature of cases. David Threlfall takes on the role of Rev Huw Owen, a deliverance ministry tutor and Merrilyâ€™s mentor.\r\n \r\nMerrily is deeply human in her doubts and scepticism, but her knowledge of the paranormal underworld brings her to the notice of local police who need her advice in the investigation of a grisly murder. Merrily has been through the mill emotionally of late, losing her unfaithful husband Sean in a car crash and seeking refuge in a job despised by her 16â€yearâ€old daughter, Jane, whose rejection of her motherâ€™s beliefs leads her into the path of danger.\r\n \r\nWhen a man is found murdered in the most horriï¬c circumstances imaginable, Merrily becomes convinced that Satanists are operating in the city. In the early hours of the next morning, she is called to Hereford General Hospital to perform an exorcism. The atmosphere is palpably toxic, as nurses treating a chronically ill man known for cruelty to animals and his abuse of women believe that the ward has become polluted by his vileness. As the life force in the shrivelled body begins to ebb away, Merrily feels the force of his depravity. Shaking and feeling violated by her experience, Merrily begins to wonder if the two deaths are connected.\r\n \r\nThe local police team â€“ DCI Annie Howe and DS Frank Bliss â€“ investigating the murder of the cruciï¬ed man seek Merrilyâ€™s expertise. Merrily assists the police as their enquiries take them into a very dark and dangerous world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5a0d7cee66eb136746d847be16f061b27920163","amp;dn":"Midwinter.of.the.Spirit.s01e01.EN.SUB.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5a0d7cee66eb136746d847be16f061b27920163","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,160,215,206,230,110,177,54,116,109,132,123,225,111,6,27,39,146,1,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
