In Guidelines for Design Solutions to Process Equipment Failures, industry experts offer their broad experience in identifying numerous solutions to the more common process equipment failures including inherent safer/passive, active, and procedural solutions, in decreasing order of robustness and reliability. The book challenges the engineer to identify opportunities for inherent and passive safety features early, and use a risk-based approach to process safety systems specification. The book is organized into three basic sections: 1) a technique for making risk-based design decisions; 2) potential failure scenarios for 10 major processing equipment categories; and 3) two worked examples showing how the techniques can be applied. The equipment categories covered are: vessels, reactors, mass transfer equipment, fluid transfer equipment, solids-fluid separators, solids handling and processing equipment, and piping and piping components","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f609ef046e31689ed6345da5cca9bac59e2a61","amp;dn":"Guidelines+for+Design+Solutions+for+Process+Equipment+Failures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47f609ef046e31689ed6345da5cca9bac59e2a61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,246,9,239,4,110,49,104,158,214,52,93,165,204,169,186,197,158,42,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
