Some tracks are from dedicated film scores, others are just individual songs that were used in the production. There's no rhyme or reason to the order, style or genre of music. All songs are in MP3 format, and are in 320kps. Oh, and ALL are awesome!!\n\nI probably could have easily come up with a list of 500 songs, but here are 50 of my faves.\n\nI hope you enjoy and please remember to seed for as long as you can!!\n\n01.
