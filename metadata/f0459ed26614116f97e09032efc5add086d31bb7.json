The          \n     core of the game is from Australian game maker Magnetic Realms with       \n     art, cutscenes, and music provided by legends of the 8 and 16-bit         \n     eras from Japan. It draws its thematic influence from the                 \n     science-fiction films and anime of the 80's and its gameplay from         \n     classic Amiga and Commodore 64 action-adventures.                         \n                                                                               \n     - Music From Keiji Yamagishi (Ninja Gaiden NES, Tecmo Bowl, Captain       \n       Tsubasa)                                                                \n                                                                               \n     - Art by staff from Secret of Mana,First Kiss Story, Mother 3, and        \n       more!                                                                   \n                                                                               \n     - NES-style cutscenes by OPUS (Half-Minute Hero)                          \n                                                                               \n                                                                               \n     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0459ed26614116f97e09032efc5add086d31bb7","amp;dn":"Exiles.End.REPACK-ALiAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0459ed26614116f97e09032efc5add086d31bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,69,158,210,102,20,17,111,151,224,144,50,239,197,173,208,134,211,27,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
