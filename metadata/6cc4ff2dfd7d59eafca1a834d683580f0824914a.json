Ucross was the first ever completely solo electric bass recording and is still consider to be an orchestral and technical triumph. Peer wrote the book on Bass harmonics - literally - so it's not surprising that his solo-bass disc is an extravaganza of ringing notes, chords and clusters. It's not just an academic demonstration, though, and Peer's pieces make a convincing case for the creative use of harmonic technique.\n\nReview\nUcross is an Audiophile Classic, and its release heralded Dean Peer's arrival to electric bass-playing's highest echelon. --Stereophile Magazine\n\nThe harmonic richness and general sonic elegance of Peer's sound cannot be overemphasized; in his hands, a four-stringed electric bass has more scope and panache than a six stringed guitar in the hands of other musicians. --Option Magazine\n\nBass performance 'A'. --Bass Player magazine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc4ff2dfd7d59eafca1a834d683580f0824914a","amp;dn":"Dean+Peer-Ucross%2C+Classic+Records+Gold+CD%2C+audiophile+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc4ff2dfd7d59eafca1a834d683580f0824914a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,196,255,45,253,125,89,234,252,161,168,52,214,131,88,15,8,36,145,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
