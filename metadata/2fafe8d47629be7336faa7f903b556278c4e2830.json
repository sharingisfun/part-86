New for this upload are the Multiple Karaoke Label choice for the more popular songs with the label info given in the title string for the first time.\r\n\r\nCDG+MP3 format.  Text file will tell you what makes up this first batch.\r\n\r\nPLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD if you have no clue how to torrent.  Poor upload and download speeds on large torrents are a pain - do not be the weakest link.  LEARN HOW TO TORRENT.  Make sure all your TCP and UDP Ports are OPEN.\r\n\r\nNext section will be upped once this is well seeded.  NOTE I USE SUPER SEEDING for the larger uploads (Called Initial Seeding in Micro Torrent).  I am using both VUZE and Micro torrent DHT systems.\r\n\r\nRigmar Radio - Seeding to the World since 2004","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fafe8d47629be7336faa7f903b556278c4e2830","amp;dn":"Rigmar+Radio+Karaoke+Collection+Part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fafe8d47629be7336faa7f903b556278c4e2830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,175,232,212,118,41,190,115,54,250,167,249,3,181,86,39,140,78,40,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
