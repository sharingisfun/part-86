E.g. the game crashes if you play\r\n      the campaign with Jorgen (black guy to the left) or if you load\r\n      certain maps in skirmish mode. We confirmed this happens on\r\n      the original game on uplay too, so this is not crack related.\r\n      The x64 version has been much more stable - so we recommend you\r\n      play that if you can until Ubisoft fixes their bugs.\r\n\t  \r\n\t  \r\n      General Notes:\r\n\r\n      - Block the game's exe in your firewall to prevent the game from \r\n        trying to go online ..\r\n      - If you install games to your systemdrive, it may be necessary\r\n        to run this game with admin privileges instead","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d24520b98e91d3fa7da04e4220704d0830f29712","amp;dn":"Might.and.Magic.Heroes.VII-CODEX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d24520b98e91d3fa7da04e4220704d0830f29712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,69,32,185,142,145,211,250,125,160,78,66,32,112,77,8,48,242,151,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
