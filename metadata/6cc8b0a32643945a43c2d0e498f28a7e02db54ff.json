The city of Metropolis (Fritz Lang, not Jor-El) is the capital of Franco-German Interland, the symbol of reconciliation in a Europe at peace for over three quarters of a century. Tensions are rising though. Then a terrorist attack on reconciliation square uncovers a secret crypt containing three murdered and mummified women. Inspector Gabriel Faune is assigned to investigate the attack, and secretly, the women's bodies. At the heart of this city stalks a mysterious killer, perhaps also the only witness of another history.\n\nenjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc8b0a32643945a43c2d0e498f28a7e02db54ff","amp;dn":"Metropolis+v3+%282015%29+%28phillywilly%29+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc8b0a32643945a43c2d0e498f28a7e02db54ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,200,176,163,38,67,148,90,67,194,208,228,152,242,138,126,2,219,84,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
