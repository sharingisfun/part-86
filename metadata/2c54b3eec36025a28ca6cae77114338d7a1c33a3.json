The Plain Truth was always a magazine ahead of it's \r\n\r\ntime. The Plain Truth began in 1934 and was the premier publication of the \r\n\r\nWorldwide Church of God under Mr. Armstrong. The Plain Truth peaked in the 1980's \r\n\r\nwith over 8 million subscriptions monthly. After the death of Mr. Armstrong in \r\n\r\n1986, the plain truth, like everything in the WCG disintegrated into nothingness.\r\n\r\n\r\nComplete Collection of every plain truth ever produced!!! Such a massive \r\n\r\ncollection I had to break it in parts. My torrent program kept crashing everytime \r\n\r\nI tried to do the whole directory. Enjoy and PLEASE SEED!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nPart 4 of 7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c54b3eec36025a28ca6cae77114338d7a1c33a3","amp;dn":"Herbert+W.+Armstrong+-+Plain+Truth+Magazine+1975-1979+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c54b3eec36025a28ca6cae77114338d7a1c33a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,84,179,238,195,96,37,162,140,166,202,231,113,20,51,141,122,28,51,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
