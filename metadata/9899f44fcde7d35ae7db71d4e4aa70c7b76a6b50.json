We react quickly to integrate detection and removal of what we think can be a global threat and affect a big amount of users across the world.\n\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a little summary of what RogueKiller is able to do:\n\nKill malicious processes\nStop malicious services\nUnload malicious DLLs from processes\nFind/Kill malicious hidden processes\nFind and remove malicious autostart entries, including :\nRegistry keys (RUN/RUNONCE, Ã¢â‚¬Â¦)\nTasks Scheduler (1.0/2.0)\nStartup folders\nFind and remove registry hijacks, including :\nShell / Load entries\nExtension association hijacks\nDLL hijacks\nMany, many others Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\nRead / Fix DNS Hijacks\nRead / Fix Proxy Hijacks\nRead / Fix Hosts Hijacks\nRead / Fix malicious Master Boot Record (MBR) or Volume Boot Record (VBR), even hidden with a rootkit\nList / Fix SSDT Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Shadow SSDT Ã¢â‚¬â€œ IRP Hooks (Even with inline hooks)\nFind and restore system files patched / hidden by a rootkit\n\n\nimage\n\n\n* Just Run to use...\n\n*Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9899f44fcde7d35ae7db71d4e4aa70c7b76a6b50","amp;dn":"RogueKiller+10.10.3.0+32+%26amp%3B+64+Bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9899f44fcde7d35ae7db71d4e4aa70c7b76a6b50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,153,244,79,205,231,211,90,231,219,113,212,228,170,112,199,183,106,107,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
