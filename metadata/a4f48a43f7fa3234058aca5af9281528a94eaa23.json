Inuyasha accepts. Every time the swords cross, Tetsusaiga gets some of its powers back. Sesshomaru creates a Meido that swallows Inuyasha, and throws Tenseiga into it. Naraku tries to control Tenseiga through Kanna's mirror. Sesshomaru jumps in the Meido and forces Inuyasha to break Tenseiga. Tetsusaiga becomes black, and Inuyasha creates a Meido to come back from the netherworld. The broken Tenseiga comes back anew. Totosai said that, freed from his obsession for Tetsusaiga, Sesshomaru is one step away from making a more powerful weapon of his own. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f48a43f7fa3234058aca5af9281528a94eaa23","amp;dn":"InuYasha+Final+Act+15+SD+-+Ortsa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f48a43f7fa3234058aca5af9281528a94eaa23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,244,138,67,247,250,50,52,5,138,202,90,249,40,21,40,169,78,170,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
