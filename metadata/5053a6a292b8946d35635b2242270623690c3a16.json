Formed in its earliest incarnation in 2006 by high school friends Spencer Charnas and Jeremy Schwartz, the group originally pursued a style combining pop punk, emo, post-hardcore and ska into their own innovative blend of rock but have since shifted into more of an experimental Metalcore hybrid. \r\n\r\nTo date, Ice Nine Kills have released two full-length studio albums; Safe Is Just a Shadow and The Predator Becomes the Prey and two EPs; The Burning and The Predator. Their most recent single, Bloodbath &amp; Beyond, was released on September 25, 2015. Their band name is derived from the fictional substance ice-nine from the science fiction novel Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut.\r\n\r\nIce Nine Kills's new album &quot;Every Trick in the Book&quot; is scheduled to be released on December 4th, 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5053a6a292b8946d35635b2242270623690c3a16","amp;dn":"Ice+Nine+Kills+Discography+2007-2015+Plus+NEW+Singles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5053a6a292b8946d35635b2242270623690c3a16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,83,166,162,146,184,148,109,53,99,91,34,66,39,6,35,105,12,58,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
