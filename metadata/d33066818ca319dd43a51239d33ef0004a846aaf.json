It is the first album to feature new drummer Mat Madiro, who joined the band in May 2014.\r\n\r\nThe band premiered &quot;Silence in the Snow&quot; and &quot;Blind Leading the Blind&quot; on their headlining performance on Bloodstock Open Air. &quot;Blind Leading the Blind&quot; was later released as a single on YouTube August 13, 2015. On August 21, 2015 a music video was released on YouTube for &quot;Blind Leading the Blind&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe third single &quot;Until the World Goes Cold&quot; premiered on Octane on August 26. The music video premiered on YouTube the day after.\r\n\r\nOn September 25, 2015, a week prior the worldwide release, the entire album was officially streamed on Octane radio. Heafy, Beaulieu and Gregoletto were participating in the programme, giving commentaries and breaking down the songwriting process and the songs themselves.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n    1 Musical style\r\n    2 Track listing\r\n    3 Personnel\r\n    \r\nMusical style\r\n\r\nGuitarist Corey Beaulieu cites Rainbow, Black Sabbath and Dio as the main influences, as well as touring experience with Heaven &amp; Hell back in 2007. He said the title song was written during Shogun sessions but was eventually cut from the final release, as the band thought it did not fit Shogunâ€â€Š'â€‹s sound.\r\n\r\nDuring the album's making, vocalist Matt Heafy has worked with vocal coach Ron Anderson, in order to improve his voice which he blew in 2014. The result of his training is a more melodic, clean singing style, without any harsh vocals being present on the album.\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\nAll songs written and composed by Trivium, except &quot;SnÃ¸fall&quot; by Ihsahn. \r\n\r\nStandard Edition \t\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\r\n1. \t&quot;SnÃ¸fall&quot;   \t1:28\r\n2. \t&quot;Silence in the Snow&quot;   \t3:40\r\n3. \t&quot;Blind Leading the Blind&quot;   \t4:25\r\n4. \t&quot;Dead and Gone&quot;   \t3:41\r\n5. \t&quot;The Ghost That's Haunting You&quot;   \t4:03\r\n6. \t&quot;Pull Me from the Void&quot;   \t3:50\r\n7. \t&quot;Until the World Goes Cold&quot;   \t5:21\r\n8. \t&quot;Rise Above the Tides&quot;   \t3:50\r\n9. \t&quot;The Thing That's Killing Me&quot;   \t3:25\r\n10. \t&quot;Beneath the Sun&quot;   \t3:52\r\n11. \t&quot;Breathe in the Flames&quot;   \t4:59\r\nTotal length:\r\n\t42:23 \t\r\n\r\n\r\n    Matt Heafy â€“ lead vocals, guitars\r\n    Corey Beaulieu â€“ guitars\r\n    Paolo Gregoletto â€“ bass guitar\r\n    Mat Madiro â€“ drums, percussion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d33066818ca319dd43a51239d33ef0004a846aaf","amp;dn":"Trivium+-+Silence+In+The+Snow+%282015%29+192ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d33066818ca319dd43a51239d33ef0004a846aaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,48,102,129,140,163,25,221,67,165,18,57,211,62,240,0,74,132,106,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
