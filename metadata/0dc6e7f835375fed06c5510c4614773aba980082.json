It exhibits a sharp understanding of the struggles in astronomy and cosmology during the past decades. As the first comprehensive film dealing with major new approaches in non-big bang cosmologies, it reveals several deep-rooted theoretical and observational controversies. This is a fact, well hidden from university students and the general public, which is recounted with candour; and potentially leads to the down-fall of the presiding Big Bang theory. More...\n\nThe actors are themselves leading figures in the field, Nobel Laureates, as well as recipients of the most important recognitions available in physics and astronomy today. While exploring the theoretical weaknesses of the dominating Big Bang cosmology, and the restrictions they impose on astronomers researching different directions, new doors are nevertheless opened for understanding the wealth of observations and stimulating ideas which have arisen in past decades. History since Hubble and Einstein is re-examined. The role media and professional prestige has played in forming and supporting this paradigm emerges sociologically, in what many consider to be an open debate with exciting potential for new understanding in cosmology. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.universe-film.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.universe-film.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE.
