In this lesson youâ€™ll learn the XML markup language used to lay out Android applications. Youâ€™ll create views, the basic building block of Android layouts, that display text and images. Then youâ€™ll position your text and images on these screens. This highly interactive lesson encourages experimentation through coding challenges in Udacityâ€™s XML Visualizer.\r\n\r\nPractice Set 1\r\n\r\nCreate a birthday card application for your phone. Youâ€™ll start by installing Android Studio, a program used by professional developers to make Android applications. Youâ€™ll then transfer a simple application you create from your computer to your phone. Following that, youâ€™ll take all the concepts you learned in Lesson 1 to build your birthday card app, and install it on your phone for your friends and family to see.\r\n\r\nLesson 2: Making an App Interactive\r\n\r\nHarness the power of Java to create an interactive coffee ordering app! Youâ€™ll start by writing simple statements in Java that add interactivity to your app. Youâ€™ll then incorporate buttons to trigger events. Youâ€™ll finally use a fundamental concept in programming, a variable, to keep track of all the coffee drinks ordered.\r\n\r\nPractice Set 2\r\n\r\nReinforce the skills learned in Lesson 2 by creating a basketball score tracker. The first part of the practice set will solidify how to write and use variables before creating your basketball score tracker app.\r\n\r\nLesson 3: Work with the Android Framework and Control Flow\r\n\r\nTake a deeper dive into the Android Framework to complete the Just Java coffee ordering app! Youâ€™ll see in more detail how Android works behind the scenes and take your first steps towards learning Object Oriented Programming. Youâ€™ll add the ability to add toppings to your coffee, and show a detailed order summary when the customer purchases a coffee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5d9875e1a3ba6309dec0a811e5444305f2d50b5","amp;dn":"Android+Development+for+Beginners+-+By+Udacity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5d9875e1a3ba6309dec0a811e5444305f2d50b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,217,135,94,26,59,166,48,157,236,10,129,30,84,68,48,95,45,80,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
