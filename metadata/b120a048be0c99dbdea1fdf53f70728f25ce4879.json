In        \n           need of money, they accept Wirth into their home. Wirth's      \n           grand occult project seals the Wollners off from the rest      \n           of the world and makes them players in a horrifying game       \n           of survival. After 71 years, in 2007, Evan Marshall's          \n           life has stalled at twenty-five years old. Left without        \n           answers after his older brother Victor's disappearance         \n           from a camping trip near Town Creek, he has tried to move      \n           on. But when Victor returns one night, very much alive         \n           and having escaped his captors, Evan asks no questions -       \n           at his brother's request, he loads their rifles, packs up      \n           their boat and follows him back to Town Creek on a             \n           mission of revenge that will test them in every possible       \n           way...                                                         \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Dominic Purcell............ : ............Victor Marshall      \n           Henry Cavill............... : ..............Evan Marshall      \n           Michael Fassbender......... : ..............Richard Wirth      \n           Emma Booth................. : ......................Liese      \n           Rainer Winkelvoss.......... : .......................Otto      \n           Tony Barger................ : ......................Larry      \n           Matthew Benson............. : ................Store Owner      \n           Albert Gherasim............ : .......................Owen      \n           Lszl Mtray.............. : .......................Karl      \n           Joy McBrinn................ : ...............Mrs. Wollner      \n           Gerard McSorley............ : ...............Mr. Marshall      \n           Andreea Perminov........... : ................Young Liese      \n           Florin Piersic Jr.......... : .................Meth Freak      \n           Vlad Voda.................. : ....................Vic Jr.      \n           Shea Whigham............... : .......................Luke      \n           Winter Ave Zoli............ : .......................Barb      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                  Thanks to our friends at KART3LDVD.
