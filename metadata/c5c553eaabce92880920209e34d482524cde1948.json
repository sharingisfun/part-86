Now you must gather them up and restore civilization to a ruined city, one building at a time.\nRebuild 3 is a strategy sim game with a good helping of narrative and dark humor. It's a thoughtful game that'll make you fond of your survivors before you send them to their deaths for the greater good. As you expand your fort to new buildings, you'll decide between farms or fortifications, housing or hospitals, and make tough decisions to fend off raiders, illness, starvation, and madness. And the dead are still out there wandering the streets, hungrier than ever.\n\nThis sequel to the &quot;unputdownable&quot; Rebuild Mobile (aka Rebuild 2) is much MUCH bigger.
