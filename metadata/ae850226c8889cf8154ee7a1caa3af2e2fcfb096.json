Under his near-obsessive guidance, young ballerina Victoria Page is poised for superstardom, but earns Lermontov's scorn when she falls in love with Julian Craster, composer of &quot;The Red Shoes,&quot; the ballet Lermontov is staging to showcase her talents. Vicky leaves the company and marries Craster, but still finds herself torn between Lermontov's demands and those of her heart. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae850226c8889cf8154ee7a1caa3af2e2fcfb096","amp;dn":"The+Red+Shoes+%281948%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae850226c8889cf8154ee7a1caa3af2e2fcfb096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,133,2,38,200,136,156,248,21,78,231,161,202,163,175,46,47,207,176,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
