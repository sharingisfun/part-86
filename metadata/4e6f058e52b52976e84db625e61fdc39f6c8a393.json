Then came â€œ Necrospectiveâ€ (november 2002) to celebrate the first ten years of the band, and their most critically acclaimed album (mixed by Anders â€œKonkhraâ€ Lundmark at the Starstruck studios in Copenhagen) â€œ Livid Corruptionâ€ in ( 22 )november 2004.\r\nFive years of massive touring, serious line up changes and with a long record deal with Holy Records expiring, the band finally put their 6h full length studio album â€œRot among usâ€ (Metal Age Productions) back 'til ( 20 ) October 2009.\r\n\r\nAfter touring extensively in support of &quot;RAU&quot; album, in March 2011 Natron enter the studio to re-record old songs included in the debut album and mini for a new brutal release.
