A big-bucks scheme goes awry: \nCardsharp Eddy (Nick Moran) and pals Bacon (Jason Statham), Tom (Jason Flemyng), and Soap (Dexter Fletcher) scuffle to pile up enough \nmoney to put Eddy at the card table opposite gangland porn lord Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty). Unfortunately, the whole plan backfires, \nleaving Eddy owing Harry a huge sum, payable within the week. In truth, Harry hopes to acquire the bar run by his rival, J.D. (Sting), who is \nEddy's father. To raise the cash, Eddy sets out to steal from a marijuana business run by Winston (Steven Mackintosh), but the inevitable \ngunplay doesn't make for an easy heist. World premiere at the 1998 Edinburgh Film Festival (Focus on British Cinema). \n\n                                       M P A A  R A T I N G  * * * \n\n\t          Rated R for strong violence, pervasive language, sexuality and drug content. \n\t                  \n                                 R E T A I L   R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\t\t\t\t1998\n\n                               \n                         T O R R E N T   R E L E A S E   D A T E  * * *\n\t\t\t\t\t01/17/10\n\n                           \n\n\t\t\t\tD V D  C o n t e n t  * * * \n  \n        Main Movie ******: \n         * Video -2981 Kbps - 5 Passes - Widescreen \n           Audio: English              \n           Language: English,Spanish\n           Subtitles: French, Spanish, English\n\n\n\n        Menu ************:\n         * Yes\n        DVD Menu\n        \n    \n\n        Extras/Special Features **********:\n         Extras UK Theatre Trailor\n        Removed **********:\n      Trailers, warnings, adverts\n\n\n      \nSide #1 --                    \n1.
