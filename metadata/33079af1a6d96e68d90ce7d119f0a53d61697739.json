The album was produced by Jason Suecof and Tim SkÃ¶ld and was released on November 13, 2012. The album's track-listing was revealed on September 20, 2012. The album leaked on October 8, 2012, more than one month before its planned release, causing a huge discussion among the band's fanbase. \r\n\r\nInfamous charted at #53 on the Billboard 200, #19 on Top Rock Albums, #9 on Top Independent Albums, and #5 on Top Hard Rock Albums. The album was also the last release from the band to feature long time drummer and co-founder of the band, Angelo Parente. The album has sold 83,000 copies as of September 2014.\r\n\r\n&quot;Infamous&quot; has received positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Alternative Press gave Infamous 5 out of 5 stars, saying that &quot;Motionless In White have definitely proven their point and carried it out well&quot; and that it sounds similar to Marilyn Manson and label mates The Word Alive. \r\n\r\nKerrang! gave Infamous 4/5 K's, saying the album &quot;sounds like the album Manson's Born Villain should have been&quot;, and that &quot;this ambitious Frankenstein's monster of an album will see Motionless In White become many people's new favorite band&quot;. Revolver said Infamous &quot;rages like Bleeding Through, and stomps like vintage Manson&quot;, and &quot;displays a compelling [musical] range for a young band&quot;, giving the album a 3.5 out of 5.\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength\r\n1. \t&quot;Black Damask (The Fog)&quot;   \tChris Cerulli, Mick Kenny \t3:51\r\n2. \t&quot;Devil's Night&quot;   \tCerulli, Ricky Olson, Drew Fulk, Jason Suecof \t3:58\r\n3. \t&quot;A-M-E-R-I-C-A&quot;   \tCerulli \t3:37\r\n4. \t&quot;Burned at Both Ends&quot;   \tCerulli, Suecof \t3:30\r\n5. \t&quot;The Divine Infection&quot;   \tCerulli \t3:38\r\n6. \t&quot;Puppets 2 (The Rain)&quot; (featuring Bjorn Strid) \tCerulli, Suecof, Olson \t4:57\r\n7. \t&quot;Sinematic&quot;   \tCerulli \t4:49\r\n8. \t&quot;If It's Dead, We'll Kill It&quot; (featuring Brandan Schieppati) \tCerulli \t3:11\r\n9. \t&quot;Synthetic Love&quot;   \tCerulli, Suecof, Michael Kenny \t3:32\r\n10. \t&quot;Hatefuck&quot;   \tCerulli \t3:11\r\n11. \t&quot;Underdog&quot;   \tCerulli, Suecof, Fulk, Kenny \t3:56\r\n12. \t&quot;Infamous&quot;   \tCerulli \t4:23\r\nTotal length:\r\n\t46:38\r\n\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\nMotionless in White\r\n\r\n    Chris &quot;Motionless&quot; Cerulli - vocals, programming, additional guitar \r\n    Ricky &quot;Horror&quot; Olson - rhythm guitar, programming\r\n    Ryan Sitkowski - lead guitar\r\n    Devin &quot;Ghost&quot; Sola - bass\r\n    Josh Balz - keyboards, synthesizers\r\n    Angelo Parente - drums\r\n    Brandon &quot;Rage&quot; Richter - drums (deluxe edition)\r\n\r\nI thought it was worth posting cause of how well Reincanation did and how I did not seem to notice this the first time around\r\n\r\nak6103\r\nOct.3 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33079af1a6d96e68d90ce7d119f0a53d61697739","amp;dn":"Motionless+in+White+-+Infamous+%282012%29+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33079af1a6d96e68d90ce7d119f0a53d61697739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,7,154,241,166,217,110,104,217,12,231,209,25,240,165,61,97,105,119,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
