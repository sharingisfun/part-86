Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nKennedy is watching Liberty die this election. Rand Paul seemed to be doing so good. Every time he stood up for freedom his numbers went up. But now the electorate doesn't seem big on those ideals. Between Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina things aren't looking so good for the liberty minded voter. (VOTE LIBERTARIAN!)\r\n\r\nRAND PAUL is in studio. First question - is liberty dead? Rand Paul says no. Just look as his support among college libertarians. He talks polling numbers, debates, running for the presidency + the senate, and marijuana, \r\n\r\nBill Clinton gave an interview defending Clinton. Apparently the whole email scandal is just a vast right wing conspiracy. We've got ANDY LEVY, DEIDRE BOLTON, and MATT KIBBE (the panel) are here to discuss. Next up - Donald Trump released his tax plan. Middle class tax relief, tax code simplification, and barriers to stop corporations from leaving the United States. (Trump and Sanders would make good bedfellows on that point.) \r\n\r\nTOPICAL STORM\r\n\r\nThe panel is back. Ben Carson has praised Kanye West's presidential bid. Mark Wahlberg makes a few jokes in front of the Pope.\r\n\r\nDANA PERINO, former white house press secretary, is here to talk about the do's and don't of dropping out of the presidential race.  1. Write your own resignation speech. 2. Signal who should replace you. 3. Take a vacation. (GTFO.) 4. Do not run up campaign debt. Take a cue from Rick Perry. 5. FEEL NO SHAME\r\n\r\nCan the people of New York tell the difference between celebrities and politicians? Kennedy hits the street on tonight's NIGHTCAP to find out.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name                            : Kennedy.2015.09.28.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\r\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\r\nCodec ID                                 : isom\r\nFile size                                : 252 MiB\r\nDuration                                 : 42mn 4s\r\nOverall bit rate                         : 839 Kbps\r\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                                       : 1\r\nFormat                                   : AVC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile                           :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration                                 : 42mn 4s\r\nBit rate                                 : 700 Kbps\r\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\r\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\r\nMinimum frame rate                       : 7.493 fps\r\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space                              : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\r\nScan type                                : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.106\r\nStream size                              : 211 MiB (83%)\r\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\r\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=700 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                                       : 2\r\nFormat                                   : AAC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile                           : LC\r\nCodec ID                                 : 40\r\nDuration                                 : 42mn 4s\r\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\r\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\r\nStream size                              : 38.5 MiB (15%)\r\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbbec3dd85844851bf8badc8abd5344eb9880f30","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.09.28.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbbec3dd85844851bf8badc8abd5344eb9880f30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,190,195,221,133,132,72,81,191,139,173,200,171,213,52,78,185,136,15,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
