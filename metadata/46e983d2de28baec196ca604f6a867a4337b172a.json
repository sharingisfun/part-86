Unfortunately, he is also a psycho and he takes off with a full load of nukes to usher in the apocalypse. \n\nFrom time to time, U.S. fighter pilots have been known to develop a messianic complex. Trainee Eddie Gordon (William O'Leary) goes a bit farther than that: he begins fantasizing that he's the Angel of Death. Armed with nuclear weaponry, Gordon flies toward Las Vegas, intending to bomb &quot;sin city&quot; back to the stone age. It is up to squadron leader Matt Ryan (Peter Strauss) to stop him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e983d2de28baec196ca604f6a867a4337b172a","amp;dn":"Flight.Of.The.Black.Angel.%281991%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e983d2de28baec196ca604f6a867a4337b172a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,233,131,210,222,40,186,236,25,108,166,4,246,168,103,164,51,123,23,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
