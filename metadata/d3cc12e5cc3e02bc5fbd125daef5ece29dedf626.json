Tarek is in high school, making Super 8 movies with his friend, Omar. At first the war is a lark: school has closed, the violence is fascinating, getting from West to East is a game. His mother wants to leave; his father refuses. Tarek spends time with May, a Christian, orphaned and living in his building. By accident, Tarek goes to an infamous brothel in the war-torn Olive Quarter, meeting its legendary madam, Oum Walid. He then takes Omar and May there using her underwear as a white flag for safe passage. Family tensions rise. As he comes of age, the war moves inexorably from adventure to tragedy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3cc12e5cc3e02bc5fbd125daef5ece29dedf626","amp;dn":"West+Beirut+%281998%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3cc12e5cc3e02bc5fbd125daef5ece29dedf626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,204,18,229,204,62,2,188,95,189,18,93,174,245,236,226,157,237,246,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
