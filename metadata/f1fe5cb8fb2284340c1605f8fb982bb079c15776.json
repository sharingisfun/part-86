JiangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s political hallmark is the massive persecution of the Falun Gong spiritual practice that he launched in 1999. The discipline, a traditional Chinese cultivation practice that teaches meditation and moral principles, had attracted around 100 million adherents by the late 1990s. Jiang ordered it eliminated, using the campaign to force officials to pledge allegiance to him and consolidate his personal power.\n\nBecause the persecution has involved mass torture, executions, forced labor, and forced organ harvestingÃ¢â‚¬â€the equivalent to an attempted religious genocideÃ¢â‚¬â€maintaining the campaign, and not being held accountable for it, became key preoccupations for Jiang. He sought to preserve his influence over the Party far past the conclusion of his official rule.\n\nSince coming to power in late 2012, the current Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been systematically attacking JiangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s web of influence, wresting control of the Party back into the hands of the formal leadership. He began by targeting the top cronies of Jiang, even after they had left their official posts. These included Zhou Yongkang, the former security chief, and two major military leaders. \n\nEver since a legal reform in China passed on May 1,2015, simplifying the conditions needed for ordinary Chinese citizens to file criminal complaints, over 160,000 Falun Gong practitioners, as of August 2015, have called upon the Chinese judiciary to prosecute Jiang.\n\nThis documentary series on DVD tells about the historical change that is taking place in China, by exposing Jiang's crimes against humanity, genocide, and how the perpetrator is being brought to justice.\n\nThe narration is in Chinese only. This DVD is recommended for watching to all Chinese.\n\nThe following lists the chapters in the DVD (in Chinese):\n\n\n  Ã£â‚¬Å Ã§Å“Å¸Ã¥Â¯Â¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â±Å¸Ã¦Â¾Â¤Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã£â‚¬â€¹\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã§Â¶â€œÃ¦Â¿Å¸Ã§â„¢Â¼Ã¥Â±â€¢Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©ï¿½â€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥Âºâ€¢Ã§Â·Å¡Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¸Å Ã¯Â¼â€°\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤ÂºÅ’Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã§Â¶â€œÃ¦Â¿Å¸Ã§â„¢Â¼Ã¥Â±â€¢Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©ï¿½â€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥Âºâ€¢Ã§Â·Å¡Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã¯Â¼â€°\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¸â€°Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¦Â±Å¸Ã¦Â¾Â¤Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã§Å¡â€žGDPÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¸Å Ã¯Â¼â€°\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥â€ºâ€ºÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¦Â±Å¸Ã¦Â¾Â¤Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã§Å¡â€žGDPÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã¯Â¼â€°\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Âºâ€Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã©ï¿½â€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥Â´Â©Ã¦Â½Â°Ã¥Â¾Å’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â¤Â¾Ã¦Å“Æ’Ã¤Âºâ€šÃ¥Æ’ï¿½Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¸Å Ã¯Â¼â€°\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥â€¦Â­Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã©ï¿½â€œÃ¥Â¾Â·Ã¥Â´Â©Ã¦Â½Â°Ã¥Â¾Å’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Â¤Â¾Ã¦Å“Æ’Ã¤Âºâ€šÃ¥Æ’ï¿½Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã¯Â¼â€°\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¸Æ’Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã¥Å“â€¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©â€šÂ£Ã¥â€¦Â©Ã¥Â¹Â´\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥â€¦Â«Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥â€¦Â­Ã¥â€ºâ€ºÃ©Å½Â®Ã¥Â£â€œÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¦Å“â‚¬Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥ï¿½â€”Ã§â€ºÅ Ã¨â‚¬â€¦\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¹ï¿½Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â·Â¨Ã¤Â¸â€“Ã§Â´â‚¬Ã¦Å½Â¥Ã§ï¿½Â­Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§â€Â±Ã¤Â¾â€ \n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥ï¿½ï¿½Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¦Â±Å¸Ã¦Â¾Â¤Ã¦Â°â€˜Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â»â€“Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¥Â³Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â‚¬â€˜\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥ï¿½ï¿½Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â³Â£Ã¥Å“â€¹Ã¦Â¢ï¿½Ã§Â´â€ž\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥ï¿½ï¿½Ã¤ÂºÅ’Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¥Â¦â€™Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Æ’Â¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸â€“Ã§Â´â‚¬Ã¨Â¿Â«Ã¥Â®Â³Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¸Å Ã¯Â¼â€°\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥ï¿½ï¿½Ã¤Â¸â€°Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¥Â¦â€™Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Æ’Â¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸â€“Ã§Â´â‚¬Ã¨Â¿Â«Ã¥Â®Â³Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¯Â¼â€°\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥ï¿½ï¿½Ã¥â€ºâ€ºÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã¥Â¦â€™Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦Æ’Â¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸â€“Ã§Â´â‚¬Ã¨Â¿Â«Ã¥Â®Â³Ã¯Â¼Ë†Ã¤Â¸â€¹Ã¯Â¼â€°\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥ï¿½ï¿½Ã¤Âºâ€Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã©â‚¬â„¢Ã¥â‚¬â€¹Ã¦ËœÅ¸Ã§ï¿½Æ’Ã¤Â¸Å Ã¥â€°ï¿½Ã¦â€°â‚¬Ã¦Å“ÂªÃ¦Å“â€°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ©â€šÂªÃ¦Æ’Â¡\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥ï¿½ï¿½Ã¥â€¦Â­Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¨Â¡â‚¬Ã¥â€šÂµÃ¥Â¹Â«Ã¥Â´Â©Ã§â€ºÂ¤\n\nÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã¥ï¿½ï¿½Ã¤Â¸Æ’Ã¯Â¼â€°Ã¨ÂµÂ·Ã¨Â¨Â´Ã§Â¬Â¬Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§Â½ÂªÃ¤ÂºÂº\n\n\nPlease help seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1fe5cb8fb2284340c1605f8fb982bb079c15776","amp;dn":"The+Real+Jiang+Zemin+%28ex-Chinese+leader%2C+the+dictator%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1fe5cb8fb2284340c1605f8fb982bb079c15776","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,254,92,184,251,34,132,52,12,22,5,248,251,152,43,176,121,193,87,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
