A puzzling but liberating discovery that convinced the band to completely stand behind their project, and release three albums to date.\r\n\r\nMore than half of the tracks in â€œSostâ€ are original compositions, with the other half being songs discovered on old cassette tapes brought back from Ethiopia. AkalÃ© WubÃ© have invited the radiant Genet Asefa on three tracks, an Ethiopian singer with whom they have often shared the stage. \r\n\r\nCautious to give precedence to authentic encounters, the band have chosen only to invite musicians with whom they have already played in a live context. Manu Dibangoâ€™s presence on the album is not an opportunistic move: there are strong human and musical ties between the afro-jazz pioneer and AkalÃ© WubÃ©. \r\n\r\nAnother sign of the bandâ€™s high quality expectations is that the album has been recorded in a studio set up by the band itself in the heart of Paris. This is a space that AkalÃ© WubÃ© have made their own and which has permitted them to master completely the process of recording this album.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Anbessa\r\n02 - Alegntaye\r\n03 - Memona\r\n04 - Kidus A Cent Dix\r\n05 - Ashewa\r\n06 - Gab's Trap\r\n07 - Addis Abeba Bete\r\n08 - Fikratchen\r\n09 - Erikum\r\n10 - Spring No Come\r\n11 - Meri Tekikil\r\n\r\n*2014 Clapson | CS1497\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore World / African Music....\r\n\r\n\r\nExtra Golden - Ok-Oyot System (2006) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.la/torrent/12577271/Extra_Golden_-_Ok-Oyot_System_%282006%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\nMakan Badje Tounkara - Sodjan (2012) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.la/torrent/8506252/Makan_Badje_Tounkara_-_Sodjan_%282012%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\nToufic Farroukh - Cinema Beyrouth (2012) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.la/torrent/8457647/Toufic_Farroukh_-_Cinema_Beyrouth_%282012%29__%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33a83aea174ca3a6c4769a4ee5604683bda71279","amp;dn":"Akale+Wube+-+Sost+%282014%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33a83aea174ca3a6c4769a4ee5604683bda71279","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,168,58,234,23,76,163,166,196,118,154,78,229,96,70,131,189,167,18,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
