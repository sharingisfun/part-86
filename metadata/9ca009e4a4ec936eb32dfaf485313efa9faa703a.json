Downloaded the only HD torrent available (3.3 GB)\n2. Opened it in Avidemux\n3. Selected video output to be MPEG4 AVC (X264), Two Pass, 768 kbit/s\n4. Selected audio to be AAC (Faac), 56 kbit/s, Remix Stereo*\n5. Selected output format to be MP4** and saved it\n6. Waited 12 hours\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n* This movie had a 6 channel audio that was making the file 900 MB.\n\n** MP4 container is fine but my TV keeps audio synchronisation better with MKV.\n\nAlso, sometimes Avidemux can tell you it can't save the audio in MP4 container after you already waited a few hours for the first pass.\n\nGood thing Avidemux can save files in diferent containers quickly and without resampling the video / audio. \n\nMany movies that my TV refused to play were fixed by changing the container from MP4 to MKV or even MKV to MKV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ca009e4a4ec936eb32dfaf485313efa9faa703a","amp;dn":"Greedy+%281994%29+720p+-+Michael+J.+Fox%2C+Kirk+Douglas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ca009e4a4ec936eb32dfaf485313efa9faa703a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,160,9,228,164,236,147,110,179,45,250,244,133,49,62,250,159,170,112,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
