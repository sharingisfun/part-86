I know. I don't like removing it either, but\r\nthere is no updated source image for LTSB version. It would\r\nmake the iso about a gig larger to include it.\r\n-Upgrade files have been re-added to iso. I could explain but\r\nit would take up too much room. The tradeoff is that netfx3 is\r\nnot integrated by default and will re-download the missing lang\r\ncomponents if you install it when you run update check next time\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nCODYQX4 - Microsoft Toolkit KMS Activator\r\nmurphy78 - Integration, ISO design, Script and testing\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nmurphy78 :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85f1752de0614b9342da988c557d166edbbca1f0","amp;dn":"Windows+10+5in1+10240+x32+en-US+Oct2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85f1752de0614b9342da988c557d166edbbca1f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,241,117,45,224,97,75,147,66,218,152,140,85,125,22,110,219,188,161,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
