Peter's employees and members consist of Owen, a man who can't \r\neven find love; Dwight, a cocky Mr. Know-It-All; Gordon, a timid, semi-shy \r\nperson and fan of obscure sports; Justin, a high school geek and Steve, a \r\npirate looking for some treasure. White, a wealthy fitness guru, just \r\nhappens to be the president/founder of the Globo Gym America Corporation \r\nand the owner/operator of the local Globo Gym, a humongous fitness centre \r\nknown to bring in the &quot;big bucks&quot; turning normal &quot;nobodies&quot; into mean, \r\nlean, &quot;superfine somebodies&quot;. White wants to close and tear down Average \r\nJoe's Gym to build a brand-new parking garage structure for the Globo \r\nGym members, so he hires Katherine Veach an attorney from a local bank to \r\nforeclose the place, giving Peter 30 days to come up with the mortgage \r\npayment of $50,000 or Average Joe's is no more forever, leaving White to \r\ntake over the gym. Unfortunately even underachievers can make dreams come \r\ntrue, so Peter, with the help of his rejected friends, decides to become \r\na Dodgeball team by playing in the American Dodgeball Association of \r\nAmerica (ADAA) International Dodgeball Competition in Las Vegas for the \r\ngrand prize of $50,000 to save their gym. Kate, who is won over Peter's \r\ncharms, join the team as well because she believes in him. But White is \r\nNOT fooled, no less stupid. His new super buff-and-tough team, known as \r\nthe &quot;Purple Cobras&quot; wants in on the action for some extra dough. All the \r\nAverage Joe's need is ex-veteran all-star Patches O' Houlihan to whip \r\nthem into killing mode shape. Can the Average Joe's kill the Globo Gym \r\nPurple Cobras, win the $50,000, and save the gym in time?\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Ben Stiller.\r\n=&gt;-Christine Taylor.\r\n=&gt;-Vince Vaughn.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Rawson Marshall Thurber.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre...........................: Comedy : Sport : Thriller.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date....................: 2004.\r\n=&gt;-Language........................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size.......................: 1.45 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate................: 2 244 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime...................: 1h 32mn.\r\n=&gt;-Dodgeball A True Underdog Story.: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dodgeball_a_true_underdog_story/\r\n=&gt;-Dodgeball A True Underdog Story.: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dodgeball-a-true-underdog-story/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec...........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio....................: 2.40:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution......................: 1920 x 800.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate........................: 2 111 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec...........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels........................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate........................: 128 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate................: 240 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72a37c0902cda609b11cc609da18bb1a13cfbd2a","amp;dn":"Dodgeball+A+True+Underdog+Story+-+Ben+Stiller+Comedy+2004+Eng+Su","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72a37c0902cda609b11cc609da18bb1a13cfbd2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,163,124,9,2,205,166,9,177,28,198,9,218,24,187,26,19,207,189,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
