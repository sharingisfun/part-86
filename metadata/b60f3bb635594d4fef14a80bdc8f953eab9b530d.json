Deputy leader Jayda Fransen and leader Paul Golding embark on a public national campaign to garner support.\r\n\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/10/13/6dec61171f991f262b674a8f41cc794a.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nIn recent months, Britain First - which says it wants to ban all trace of Islam from the UK - has emerged as a new name in far right politics. With a 29-year-old-woman, Jayda Fransen, as the face of the party, and with an online following bigger than any other UK party, Britain First says that it is ready to become a household name and credible force in British politics.\r\n\r\nFilm director Miles Blayden-Ryall joins deputy leader Jayda and leader Paul Golding (ex-BNP press officer) as they embark on their first public national campaign to garner support.\r\n\r\nWith seemingly huge numbers viewing the provocative videos they produce and backing them online, they say that the British public is ready to turn out in huge numbers for them and that, as a result, the authorities view them as dangerous and want to shut them down.\r\n\r\nBlayden-Ryall is with them on the streets of the UK as they attempt to rally big numbers around their cause, in the face of growing opposition. But do they have any hope of succeeding? Have the British public really become so intolerant that they will get behind a party with such extreme views?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b60f3bb635594d4fef14a80bdc8f953eab9b530d","amp;dn":"We+Want+Our+Country+Back+EN+SUB+x265+%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b60f3bb635594d4fef14a80bdc8f953eab9b530d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,15,59,182,53,89,77,79,239,20,168,11,220,143,149,62,171,155,83,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
