Their style draws mostly from 60s to early-70s R&amp;B, updated with crisper 80s bass and percussion. Lead singer Roland Gift sometimes sounds like Al Green, and has the genuine appeal of a sincere imitator.\r\nThe two best songs are &quot;Good Thing&quot; and &quot;Take What I Can Get&quot;. &quot;Good Thing&quot; is driven by the repeated hammering of piano power chords. For you 60s fans unfamiliar with it, it has the pounding beat of &quot;Can I Get a Witness?&quot; and the chord progression of &quot;Liar Liar, Pants on Fire&quot;, but it also has a snappy guitar, a great lead vocal, and I love that &quot;dwee-dwee doo-be-doo&quot; in the background. This song is so much fun, I like to play it twice in a row, and you can see the Cannibals perform it live in the movie &quot;Tin Men&quot;. &quot;Take What I Can Get&quot; features Roland's best vocal, a nice melody and good brave lyrics about unrequited love. Other good songs are &quot;Since You've Been Gone&quot;, and the rocking &quot;Don't Look Back&quot;. Nice but not great are the echo-y &quot;Funny How Love Is&quot;, the sweet, reggae-tinged &quot;Tell Me What&quot;, &quot;The Flame&quot;, and the best Al Green impersonation of all in &quot;I'm Not the Man I Used to Be&quot;. &quot;Couldn't Care More&quot; is interesting - I thought I didn't like it at first, but it has grown on me. The rest of the songs are no better than listenable, including their hit &quot;She Drives Me Crazy&quot; and their reinterpretation of Elvis' &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, a song not well suited to them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f08e765ed3965ec7594a3c52974597eea52ad39c","amp;dn":"Fine+Young+Cannibals+-+The+Finest+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f08e765ed3965ec7594a3c52974597eea52ad39c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,142,118,94,211,150,94,199,89,74,60,82,151,69,151,238,165,42,211,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
