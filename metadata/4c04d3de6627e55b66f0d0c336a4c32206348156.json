Despite the lack of a hit single, media notoriety or the usual music business hype, much less major-label backing, their 1993 album Jurassic Shift was a UK top twenty album, and their hardcore audience is both dedicated and loyal to the band's unique sound. \r\n\r\nAt the core of the band's music is an exploration of electronic musical textures and compulsive, danceable grooves interlaced with strong melodies and multi-ethnic musical references.\r\n\r\nDue to be released through Madfish, Technicians of the Sacred is set to be released as a 2 disc digipack with the stunning mystical album artwork created by Ozric family member Natan, flowing through to the 8 panels of the digipack\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n01.
