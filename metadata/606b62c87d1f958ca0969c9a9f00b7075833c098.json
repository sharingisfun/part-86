Biological Technology\r\n2. Chemical Technology\r\n3. Containment and Barrier Technology\r\n4. Immobilization Technology\r\n5. Membrane Technology\r\n6. Physical Technology\r\n7. Radiation and Electrical Technology\r\n8. Thermal Destruction Technology\r\n\r\nTraditional technologies have been included, as well as those that can be considered innovative and emerging. The traditional approaches have been the most successful, as contractors are careful about bidding on some of the newer technologies. However, as regulatory requirements increase, markets will open for the innovative and emerging processes. There will be increasing pressure to break down complex waste streams, with each subsequent stream demanding separate treatment. In addition, a number of technologies have been developed by combining processes directly, or in a treatment train, and these developments are expected to assume increasing importance. However, such concerns as uncertainties due to liability, regulatory approval, price competition, and client approval have limited the application of some of these newer technologies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:606b62c87d1f958ca0969c9a9f00b7075833c098","amp;dn":"Unit+Operations+in+Environmental+Engineering+-+Robert+Noyes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"606b62c87d1f958ca0969c9a9f00b7075833c098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,107,98,200,125,31,149,140,160,150,156,154,159,0,183,7,88,51,192,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
