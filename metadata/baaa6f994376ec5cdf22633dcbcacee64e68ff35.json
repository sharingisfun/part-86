Part one covers architectures for VCS, part two describes the physical layer, antenna technologies and propagation models, part three explores protocols, algorithms, routing and information dissemination, and part four looks at the operation and deployment of vehicular communications and networks.\r\n\r\n- Comprehensive coverage of the fundamental principles behind Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETS) and the rapidly growing need for their further development\r\n- Thorough overview of the design and development of key technologies and devices\r\n- Explores the practical application of this technology by outlining a number of case studies, testbeds and simulations employing vehicular communications and networks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baaa6f994376ec5cdf22633dcbcacee64e68ff35","amp;dn":"Vehicular+Communications+and+Networks+%5B2015%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baaa6f994376ec5cdf22633dcbcacee64e68ff35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,170,111,153,67,118,236,92,223,34,99,61,203,202,206,230,78,104,255,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
