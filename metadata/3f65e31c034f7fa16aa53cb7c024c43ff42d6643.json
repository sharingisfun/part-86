Savannah and Cooper, a young couple in love, drive through the desert in a black 70s Cadillac convertible. Unaware that they are being followed, they check into a motel at the Mexican border. When Savannah leaves to buy food, a cop sneaks into the room, pulls his gun on Cooper, accuses him of murder and tries to arrest him. But Savannah, who had become suspicious, manages to turn the tables: She surprises the cop, ties him up and frees Cooper. But just as the young lovers jump into their car, a stranger steps out of the shadows and kills Cooper at point blank... Three weeks later.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f65e31c034f7fa16aa53cb7c024c43ff42d6643","amp;dn":"Absolute.Evil.2009.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f65e31c034f7fa16aa53cb7c024c43ff42d6643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,101,227,28,3,79,127,161,106,165,60,183,192,36,196,63,244,45,102,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
