Prior to ABKCO's comprehensive 2006 reissue program, the US versions of the Stones' early albums were the de facto standards on CD, but particularly in the case of 1966's AFTERMATH, the UK album was very different.\r\n\r\nThe track lineup is shuffled and expanded to create a much different mood. &quot;Paint It Black&quot; is gone, replaced as the opening track by the snotty social commentary of &quot;Mother's Little Helper,&quot; which--when followed by &quot;Stupid Girl,&quot; &quot;Lady Jane,&quot; &quot;Under My Thumb,&quot; and &quot;Dontcha Bother Me&quot;--is like a pentathlon of punky misogyny capped by the grinding blues jam &quot;Goin' Home.&quot; Side Two is more emotionally varied but just as musically far-reaching, adding the poppy &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot; and &quot;What To Do&quot; to an already strong set of tunes centered on the stunning full-length version of &quot;Out of Time&quot; that for ome reason had never been released in the United States before this belated reissue. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Mothers Little Helper\r\n02 - Stupid Girl\r\n03 - Lady Jane\r\n04 - Under My Thumb\r\n05 - Doncha Bother Me\r\n06 - Goin' Home\r\n07 - Flight 505\r\n08 - High And Dry\r\n09 - Out Of Time\r\n10 - It's Not Easy\r\n11 - I Am Waiting\r\n12 - Take It Or Leave It\r\n13 - Think\r\n14 - What To Do\r\n\r\n*2006 ABKCO Records / Universal Music Japan | UICY-93021\r\n{Japan Mini LP Remastered 2006, UICY-93020}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMore Rolling Stones Japan Mini LP DSD Remaster 2006:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rolling Stones - 12x5 (1964) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n      \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10760623/The_Rolling_Stones_-_12x5_%281964%29__%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rolling Stones - England's Newest Hit Makers (1964) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n       \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10751837/The_Rolling_Stones_-_England_s_Newest_Hit_Makers_%281964%29_%5BEAC-FLA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rolling Stones - The Rolling Stones, Now!
