YOUNG@HEART chronicles seven weeks in the lives of the members of the chorus as they prepare for a one-night-only concert in their hometown of Northampton, Massachusetts. The group is made up of two dozen spirited seniors ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ former schoolteachers, executives, doctors, and food service workers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ who specialize in reinterpreting rock, punk, and R&amp;B classics from a unique perspective. What ultimately emerges in the film is a funny and unexpectedly moving testament to friendship, creative inspiration, and expectations defied.\n\nLed by Bob Cilman, their demanding musical director, the retirees are rehearsing their new show, struggling with Sonic YouthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dissonant rock anthem ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSchizophrenia,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and giving new meaning to James BrownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Feel Good.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ With less than two months to go until the concert, the performers grapple with new lyrics and unfamiliar melodies. During their thrice-weekly rehearsals, they gradually take possession of music ranging from R&amp;B classics like Allen ToussaintÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYes We Can CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to ColdplayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s emotionally powerful ballad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFix You,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ upending assumptions about old age, love, sex, and death.\n\nFrom 92-year-old Eileen HallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rousing rendition of The ClashÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShould I Stay or Should I Go?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to 75-year-old Pat LindermeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s moving interpretation of PrinceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNothing Compares 2 U,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ each performance responds to the ravages of age with startling emotional depth. And, after almost two months of shooting, the Young@Heart Chorus delivers a triumphant performance that celebrates the joy of music and the lives of their lost friends. The end result is an inspirational journey with a singular group of people who may be old in body, but refuse to grow old in spirit.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 931 MiB for 1h 56mn 39s 699ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English US\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documenatary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 968 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 134 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5b73b16ac7db93aa5a6e77512f3c3f8e6d13bbe","amp;dn":"PBS+Independent+Lens-Young%40Heart.Jan+12%2C2010.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5b73b16ac7db93aa5a6e77512f3c3f8e6d13bbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,183,59,22,172,125,185,58,165,166,231,117,18,243,195,248,230,209,59,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
