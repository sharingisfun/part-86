It is the follow-up to their previous full-length studio album Bridges to Babylon from 1997; that gap of eight years was the longest between studio albums of the band's recording career, although the band has not issued a studio album of new material since. Released as a double album on vinyl and a single CD, it was produced by Don Was and The Glimmer Twins.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. &quot;Rough Justice&quot; 3:11\n2. &quot;Let Me Down Slow&quot; 4:16\n3. &quot;It Won't Take Long&quot; 3:54\n4. &quot;Rain Fall Down&quot; 4:54\n5. &quot;Streets of Love&quot; 5:10\n6. &quot;Back of My Hand&quot; 3:32\n7. &quot;She Saw Me Coming&quot; 3:12\n8. &quot;Biggest Mistake&quot; 4:06\n9. &quot;This Place Is Empty&quot; 3:12\n10. &quot;Oh No, Not You Again&quot; 3:46\n11. &quot;Dangerous Beauty&quot; 3:48\n12. &quot;Laugh, I Nearly Died&quot; 4:54\n13. &quot;Sweet Neo Con&quot; 4:33\n14. &quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot; 3:57\n15. &quot;Driving Too Fast&quot; 3:56\n16. &quot;Infamy&quot; 3:47\n\n\nImages :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/album/EA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/album/EA&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSEED \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mik&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/mik&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4b46928ffc04313125ab2abe624fcc616f75dae","amp;dn":"Rolling+Stones+-+A+Bigger+Bang+%28+2005+%29+%5B+MP3+320kbps+%5D+-+Freak3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4b46928ffc04313125ab2abe624fcc616f75dae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,180,105,40,255,192,67,19,18,90,178,171,230,36,252,198,22,247,93,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
