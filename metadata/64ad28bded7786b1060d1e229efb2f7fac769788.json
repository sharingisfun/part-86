The artistic ferment which had taken hold of Florence by 1420 was also reflected in the regional schools of Siena, Umbria, Mantua and Rome; and the new ideas spread from Italy through France, the Netherlands, Austria, Spain and Portugal. The book includes artists as diverse as Piero della Francesca, Van Eyck, Durer, Mantegna and Bellini, as well as the High Renaissance masters Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael. With superb illustrations of the artists' work and crucial historical information about the &quot;rebirth&quot; of arts and letters, the authors illuminate one of the most important periods of art history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ad28bded7786b1060d1e229efb2f7fac769788","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+the+Renaissance+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ad28bded7786b1060d1e229efb2f7fac769788","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,173,40,189,237,119,134,177,6,13,30,34,158,251,47,127,172,118,151,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
