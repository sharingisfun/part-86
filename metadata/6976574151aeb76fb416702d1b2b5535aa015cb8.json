Simon has a tough time in his own reality. In the far-away Magic Kingdom, he was celebrated as a hero, but at home, he can't really succeed in anything, not even winning a quarrel over the remote control with his little brother â€“ instead, said remote control hits him on the head and forces him into an involuntary midday nap.\r\nWhile dreaming, a well-known young lady appears to him: Alix, granddaughter of the wizard Calypso, who first summoned Simon into the Magic Kingdom. She reveals that the kingdom is in terrible danger and that he is needed again to save its inhabitants.\r\nSimon doesn't need to be told twice.
