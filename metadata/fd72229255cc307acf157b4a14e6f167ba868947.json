They began writing some material but nothing really happened until Spring 1993 where they got in touch with German Poserslaughter Records that offerend them a 7&quot; EP split with Australian Blood Duster. But after a while it turned out to be a split with Agathocles. Before the recording of the material Mieszko Talarczyk (guitar) joined the band. The split with Agathocles was released and entitled &quot;Blind World&quot;. The band had also sent a tape (containing songs from the split) to various labels in order to get more EP offeres etc. They recieved two offers, one offering a split-7&quot; EP with Psycho on their own label Ax/ction Records, but also an opportunity to participate on the well-reputated Swedish hardcore comp-LP &quot;Really Fast&quot;'s 9th volume. \r\n\r\n[b]Nasum â€Žâ€“ Inhale / Exhale\r\nGenre:[/b] Rock\r\n[b]Style:[/b] Grindcore\r\n[b]Year:[/b] 1998\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/m2aIEij.png\r\n\r\nExact Audio Copy V1.1 from 23.
