The book discusses concrete principles, appropriate design, and operational aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt covers a wide variety of MBR topics, including filtration theory, membrane materials and geometry, fouling phenomena and properties, and strategies for minimizing fouling. Also covered are the practical aspects such as operation and maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCase studies and examples in the book help readers understand the basic concepts and principles clearly, while problems presented help advance relevant theories more deeply. Readers will find this book a helpful resource to understand the state of the art in MBR technology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff574efcb9a052ad2f79fa2b34ef5b5dda1ac73a","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Membrane+Bioreactors+for+Wastewater+Treatment","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff574efcb9a052ad2f79fa2b34ef5b5dda1ac73a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,87,78,252,185,160,82,173,47,121,250,43,52,239,91,93,218,26,199,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
