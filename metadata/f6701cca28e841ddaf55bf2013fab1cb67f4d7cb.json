It's time to break it off with government! Here's our show:\r\n\r\nLOVE GOV: The Independent Institute and Emergent Order's video series &quot;Love Gov&quot; portrays federal government as an overbearing boyfriend named Gov whose &quot;good intentions&quot; ultimately ruin his girlfriend Alexis' life.\r\n\r\nOBAMACARE: Like Gov, Obamacare is premised on the idea that government knows what's best for you. Leftist radio host Richard Fowler says it actually does. He and I debate.\r\n\r\nNSA SPYING: Anna and Peter Smith sued President Obama to stop its surveillance program. They've passed their first legal hurdle and reached an appeals court. They discuss their suit with me. But I don't agree with libertarians! I think bulk data collection may be okay.\r\n\r\nAID TO HOMEOWNERS: President Obama, the FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac blow more air into the next housing bubble. The Reason's Foundation's Anthony Randazzo explains why this is a scam that benefits rich people while hurting taxpayers.\r\n\r\nBUSINESS REGULATIONS: Jared Meyer of the Manhattan Institute says business regulations hurt employment and keep out competition.\r\n\r\nMY TAKE: Americans need the courage to break it off with government!.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.09.25.Breaking.Up.With.Government.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\r\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\r\nCodec ID                                 : isom\r\nFile size                                : 247 MiB\r\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\r\nOverall bit rate                         : 839 Kbps\r\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                                       : 1\r\nFormat                                   : AVC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile                           :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\r\nBit rate                                 : 700 Kbps\r\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\r\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\r\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\r\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space                              : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\r\nScan type                                : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.106\r\nStream size                              : 206 MiB (83%)\r\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\r\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=700 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                                       : 2\r\nFormat                                   : AAC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile                           : LC\r\nCodec ID                                 : 40\r\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\r\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\r\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\r\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (15%)\r\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6701cca28e841ddaf55bf2013fab1cb67f4d7cb","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.09.25.Breaking.Up.With.Government.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6701cca28e841ddaf55bf2013fab1cb67f4d7cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,112,28,202,40,232,65,221,175,85,191,32,19,250,177,203,103,244,215,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
