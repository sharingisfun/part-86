It is the second single from their self-titled debut album, as well as their second Top 20 hit on the Billboard country charts. The song was co-written by the trio's three members (Dave Haywood, Charles Kelley, and Hillary Scott) along with Keith FollesÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, and it features lead vocals from both Kelley and Scott.\n\n&quot;Lookin' for a Good Time&quot; received a &quot;thumbs up&quot; review from the country music site The 9513. Although reveiwer Matt C. called the storyline &quot;fairly pedestrian&quot; and said that the producers &quot;[did] their best to ruin&quot; the song, he also made note of Kelley's &quot;distinctive, husky voice&quot; and the alternating lead vocals, adding &quot;IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not likely to confuse this group with any other artist on country radio, and when you combine this special quality with two fine vocalists and the trioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s generally smart (if unremarkable) musical sensibilities, I have a hard time imagining the Lady Antebellum single that I will truly dislike.&quot;\n\nLady Antebellum is the self-titled debut album by the American country music trio Lady Antebellum.
