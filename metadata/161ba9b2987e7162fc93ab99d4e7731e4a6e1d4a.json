Plants are becoming larger and are often situated in or close to densely\r\npopulated areas. Increased hazard of loss of life or property is continually highlighted with incidents such as Flixborough, Bhopal, Chernobyl and Piper Alpha.\r\nIncreasing attention must therefore be paid to the control of these hazards, and in particular the need to develop a comprehensive approach to the avoidance of human and economic loss; this is loss prevention. Frank Lees has completely rewritten this classic reference work on loss prevention, bringing every aspect up to date. New chapters are included on computers, artificial intelligence and expert systems, and new appendices feature recent disasters such as Bhopal and Piper Alpha. The many thousands of references have been updated along with standards and codes of practice. Written in a clear and concise style, 'Loss Prevention in the Process Industries' covers traditional areas of personal safety as well as the more technological aspects and thus provides balanced and in-depth coverage of the whole field of safety and loss prevention","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:161ba9b2987e7162fc93ab99d4e7731e4a6e1d4a","amp;dn":"Loss+Prevention+in+the+Process+Industries+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"161ba9b2987e7162fc93ab99d4e7731e4a6e1d4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,27,169,178,152,126,113,98,252,147,171,153,212,231,115,30,74,110,29,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
