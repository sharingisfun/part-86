It received mixed reviews. Anchored by their 1976 cover of &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;, recorded to aid Jimmy Carter in his bid for the White House[1], and surrounded by tracks dating to 1972, it was simply finished to get the group off of Capitol Records, so that the soundtrack to their film The Last Waltz could come out on Warner Bros.
