Hiding from The Man, skulking in shadows, the thrill of infiltration. But why do they have to be so... slow?\r\nThat was the question that spawned Stealth Bastard, the fast-paced, nail-biting antidote to tippy-toed sneaking simulators that the world had so desperately been craving. Now, building on the ideas sketched out in this unholy marriage of deft, wall-hugging stealthiness and insane break-neck platforming, weâ€™re proud to bring you the bigger, better, shinier Stealth Bastard Deluxe.\r\nStay out of the light to avoid the attention of deadly security robots! Leap like a lusty salmon to avoid those zap-happy lasers! Think fast as the walls close in around you! Only the fastest and sneakiest will make it to the exit without being mangled by the facilityâ€™s security systems. Will you be among them?\r\nFeatures:\r\nCampaign Mode: 80 levels spread across eight worlds, featuring tricky puzzles, platforming challenges and a wide range of sharp-eyed security bots who are entirely unsympathetic to your plight.\r\nDynamic Lighting: Stay in the shadows cast by Stealth Bastard Deluxeâ€™s dynamic lighting system to escape the attention of enemies and security cameras.\r\nEquipment: The Camo Suit, the Decoy, the Sonic Decoy, the Antilight and the Teleporters provide new ways of outfoxing enemies in every level.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor:Dual Core 2.5Ghz\r\nMemory:2 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: DirectX 8.0 compatible\r\nDirectXÂ®: 8.0\r\nHard Drive:250 MB HD space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2901ab399a3b857b45df7434ad562e06d7ee289a","amp;dn":"Stealth+Bastard+Deluxe+Complete+Edition+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2901ab399a3b857b45df7434ad562e06d7ee289a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,1,171,57,154,59,133,123,69,223,116,52,173,86,46,6,215,238,40,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
