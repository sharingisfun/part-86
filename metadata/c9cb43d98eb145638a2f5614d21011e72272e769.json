The preparation of such a volume has often been urged upon me by those who have listened to my lectures on Palestine Exploration.\r\n\r\nIn such a work accuracy is of more value than originality; and therefore I have not hesitated to gather information from the best sources, and to use it freely. The authorities and sources will be found in a list at the end of each chapter; and thus, while due acknowledgment is made, the reader will know where to go to for further information.\r\n\r\nIn one chapter, indeed - that relating to the topography of Jerusalem in Scripture times - I do venture to state my own views, and give my own map of localities; but it is only because my special study of the subject seems to justify my confidence, and compels me to differ from other writers.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9cb43d98eb145638a2f5614d21011e72272e769","amp;dn":"Buried+Cities+and+Bible+Countries+-+George+St+Clair+%5BEN+PDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9cb43d98eb145638a2f5614d21011e72272e769","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,203,67,217,142,177,69,99,138,47,86,20,210,16,17,231,34,114,231,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
