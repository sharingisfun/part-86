The man is urged to go somewhere, but his car is not ready yet, so the nurse offers him a ride. Before leaving the man, they pick up the nurse's baby nephew. Once on the street, they almost run over a young man. Not knowing if he is hurt, they pick up the man too. But the worst luck begins when the car brakes break down. \n\n\nStars: Judge Reinhold, Nina Siemaszko, Brian Hooks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e60b3502fe3698a84697bac830019a0ea6980b3","amp;dn":"Runaway+Car+%281997%29+TVRip+x264+AAC-pong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e60b3502fe3698a84697bac830019a0ea6980b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,96,179,80,47,227,105,138,132,105,123,172,131,0,25,160,234,105,128,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
