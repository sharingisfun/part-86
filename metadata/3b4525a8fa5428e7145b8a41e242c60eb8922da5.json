Also we don't race, we never did we haven't 'lost' anything we\n      take time to do these INTERNALs as they are in high-demand... The\n     facts are you don't care and you're incompetent. You can change your\n        name all you want IMMERSE/FLEET people see right through it...\n        Nothings changed, you haven't improved anything.
