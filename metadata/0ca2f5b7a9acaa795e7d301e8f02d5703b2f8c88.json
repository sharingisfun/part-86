Ensure all disc images are checked with abgx as LT assumes all stealth/ss/pfi/dmi is correct. Disc images must also be splitvid and preferred SS v2\n\nWarning! Lt will not save you from being banned if console is already flagged by using a previous firmware or non-stealth discs\n\nIt is also advisable to apply all system updates before flashing with LT. All future console system updates (not game updates) must be applied with caution\n\n###### WARNING ######\n\n\nThanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.\nThanks also go to Team Xecuter for their generous support to this project.
