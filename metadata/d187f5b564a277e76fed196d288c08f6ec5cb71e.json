Food Flavors: Chemical, Sensory, and Technological Properties explores the main aspects of food flavors and provides a starting point for further study in focused areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTopics discussed include:\r\n\r\nThe nature of food odorants and tastants and the way they are perceived by the human olfactory system\r\n\r\nBasic anatomy and physiology of sensory systems involved in flavor sensation, olfactory pathways, and interactions between olfactory and gustatory stimuli\r\n\r\nThe fundamentals of flavor compounds formation based on their main precursors (lipids, amino acids, and carbohydrates)\r\n\r\nTechnological issues related to flavor compounds\r\n\r\nPhysicochemical characteristics of aroma compounds and the main factors that influence aroma binding and release in foods\r\n\r\nSafety and regulatory aspects of flavorings used in foods\r\n\r\nFlavors of essential oils and spices, cheeses, red meat, wine, and bread and bakery products\r\n\r\nFood taints and off-flavors\r\n\r\nAnalytical approaches to characterize food flavors\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe book also explores the latest technology in artificial olfaction systems with a chapter on the main physical and chemical features of these sensors. Bringing together the combined experience of a host of international experts, the book provides insight into the fundamentals of food flavors and explores the latest advances in flavor analysis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d187f5b564a277e76fed196d288c08f6ec5cb71e","amp;dn":"Food+Flavors+-+Chemical%2C+Sensory+and+Technological+Properties","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d187f5b564a277e76fed196d288c08f6ec5cb71e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,135,245,181,100,162,119,231,111,237,25,109,40,140,8,246,236,92,183,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
