Ask any of the guys from Pyramid Room, and they'll tell you &quot;Your imagination is your only limit.&quot; And that's exactly the way in which they approach their music. But then again, it's not too hard to understand why. After all, who could imagine an ex-fighter pilot, childhood friends and work colleagues together in the same band?\n \nForming in 2012, the Sydney based 4-piece outfit fuses together the energy, emotion and technicality evident from their wide array of musical tastes and backgrounds. Influenced by artists such as Deep Purple, Muse, Opeth, Foo Fighters, Metallica and Sevendust, the band's songs have been described as &quot;explosive&quot;, &quot;compelling&quot; and &quot;grand&quot;.\n \nMegan from Emergenza Festival Australia writes: &quot;With vocals that lie anywhere between alt metal, emo and post-grunge, the djent rhythm sections and double bass pedal, alternated between ballad-like arpeggiated guitar and power riffs, this band covers a lot of territory. The result is a totally explosive sound, where the one common denominator is their total conviction in what theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re creating.&quot;\n \nThe band's mission is simple - bring rock to the masses but connect with the individual. Whether it's inner demons, fighting the corporate rule, or appreciating a moment of beauty, Pyramid Room has a story to share with you.\n\nPlease support the artist. www.pyramidroom.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97b9be4e97c6dbba7651aefad715bf48ef3fcdf6","amp;dn":"Pyramid+Room+-+Wonder+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97b9be4e97c6dbba7651aefad715bf48ef3fcdf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,185,190,78,151,198,219,186,118,81,174,250,215,21,191,72,239,63,205,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
