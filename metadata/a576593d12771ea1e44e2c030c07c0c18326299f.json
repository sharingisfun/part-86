The new extended Gerber format contains embedded aperture          \n information, and this minimizes the risk for errors during the              \n manufacturing of the PCB.                                                  \n                                                                             \n With GerbView's PDF to CAD capability you can convert your Adobe PDF        \n files back to Gerber or Autodesk DXF.\n\n\nGerbView Key Features\n\n   View, print, markup and convert Gerber, Adobe PDF, Excellon, HPGL/2 and raster formats.\n   Convert to AutoDesk DXF, Adobe PDF, AutoDesk DWF and other formats.\n   Convert multiple Gerber files to a multi layer PDF, DWF or DXF file.
