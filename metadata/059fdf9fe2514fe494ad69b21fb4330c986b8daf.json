For most of the last decade, Argoteâ€™s band has existed as a Jekyll/Hyde operation, oscillating between thrashing noise rock and hushed folk. Depending on her lineup, a Des Ark show might find her making a mockery of ear plugs, contorting her body into impossible positions to force the cruelest sounds from her instrument, or playing for a crowd seated on the floor, inviting them to squeeze in closer in order to hear her over her unplugged guitar.\r\nArgote makes either extreme feel like her natural state on stage, though capturing both on the same record has proved more of a challenge. 2011â€™s Donâ€™t Rock the Boat, Sink the Fucker positioned scorching punk uncomfortably against pretty but sometimes overworked songs that lost some of the intensity of Argoteâ€™s solo performances. On Everything Dies, she avoids that whiplash. Though it was recorded in bits and pieces at six studios in five states over a span of several years, with a range of collaborators including Swansâ€™ Thor Harris, Engine Downâ€™s Jonathan Fuller, and Saddle Creek journeyman Andy LeMaster, it coheres like the product of a single session.\r\n\r\nNo track benefits more from this unified approach than â€œTiesâ€. Argote has been kicking that song around since at least 2007, when it first appeared under the misleadingly silly title â€œCovert Conspiracy of Spanish Speaking Catsâ€ on a solo session Argote recorded for the Durham station WXDU. On its Everything Diesâ€˜ update, sheâ€™s accompanied by imposing guitars and drums that give the song thrust, underscoring Argoteâ€™s violent imagery without drowning out the dread in her voice. Itâ€™s the most devastating song sheâ€™s ever written, a chilling documentation of the tolls of loving an addictâ€”the promises they might break, the things they might steal, and the bruises they might leave. â€œHere it is,â€ she sings, â€œThe bathtub where youâ€™ll find the love of your life, choking up his own blood.â€ The words seem to fight her as they leave her mouth.\r\n\r\nNot all of Everything Dies is so bleakâ€”it couldnâ€™t be. â€œFrench Fries Are Magicalâ€ plays like a prolonged hug, as does the albumâ€™s most unabashedly pretty number, â€œStreet Woodsâ€. And the one song on the record that does live up to its irreverent title, â€œDon Taco &amp; His Hot Sauce Tossâ€, is downright gleeful, a communal rejoice that falls somewhere between the Polyphonic Spreeâ€™s rainbow sing-alongs and the radiant pop of Feistâ€™s The Reminder.\r\n\r\nAs on Donâ€™t Rock the Boat, there are moments on Everything Dies where you canâ€™t help but wonder how a songwriter this good has existed so far below the radar of so many listeners. In a recent interview with After Ellen, Argote shed some light on why that might be, explaining that she prefers to play queer-friendly venues and safe spaces removed from the threats and harassment that women face at traditional venues. â€œI donâ€™t really feel like I need to cultivate a male audience,â€ she explained. â€œMy songs are written for women and theyâ€™re written for queer people; those are the people Iâ€™ve been closest to in my life, who I obviously want to share my music with â€¦ Really what I would like to do is create spaces that are safe for everybody and since I identify as queer I think it helps.â€\r\n\r\nThose comments sparked some distracting backlash from male commenters somehow upset that a woman might want to target her music at her own community, but they reveal a lot about these songs. For all the turmoil it confronts, Everything Dies really does create that sense of safety. Nearly every song extends a hand to the abused, the subjugated, or the otherwise marginalized and reassures them theyâ€™ll be all right. â€œIâ€™ll bandage up your arms, your legs, and leave you where the wounded lay,â€ she offers a lover on â€œConey Island Street Meatâ€. Argote cycles through nearly every emotion imaginable in these songs, but the one that drives her the most is concern.\r\nRating 8.7/10\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\nDes Ark - Everything Dies - 01 Peace To You Too, Motherfucker.flac\r\nDes Ark - Everything Dies - 02 Ties.flac\r\nDes Ark - Everything Dies - 03 Coney Island Street Meat.flac\r\nDes Ark - Everything Dies - 04 You Pregnant Motherfucker.flac\r\nDes Ark - Everything Dies - 05 Snake Stuff.flac\r\nDes Ark - Everything Dies - 06 Don Taco &amp; His Hot Sauce Toss.flac\r\nDes Ark - Everything Dies - 07 French Fries are Magical.flac\r\nDes Ark - Everything Dies - 08 Street Woods.flac\r\nDes Ark - Everything Dies - 09 Nitetime Moths.flac\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCountry: USA\r\nGenre: Indie-Folk\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~748-897 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:059fdf9fe2514fe494ad69b21fb4330c986b8daf","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Des+Ark+-+Everything+Dies+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"059fdf9fe2514fe494ad69b21fb4330c986b8daf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,159,223,159,226,81,79,228,148,173,105,178,31,180,51,12,152,107,141,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
