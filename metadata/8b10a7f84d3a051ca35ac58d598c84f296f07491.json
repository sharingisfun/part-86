It has also been announced that everything unlocked in the first play through will be transferred over to new games.\n\nThe game also features &quot;tactical freedom&quot;, which is different ways of achieving the same goal. For instance, in the game, the \n\nplayer must take down an Archon, a large robotic enemy manned by a Watcher. The first way to take it down is by shooting its leg \n\njoints, rendering the giant enemy incapacitated. Once this is done, the player must climb onto the Archon's tail, triggering a \n\nmini-game, and fight the Watcher that's controlling it. A different way of accomplishing all this is by hijacking an enemy UFO and \n\nblasting the Archon with the ship's cannons until it explodes.\n\n\n\nMinimum System Requirements :\n=============================\n\n\n     CPU:\n        - Intel(R) Pentium(R) D processor or higher\n        - AMD Athlon(TM) 64 X2 or higher\n\n     System RAM:\n        - Windows(R) XP : at least 512MB\n        - Windows Vista(R) : at least 1GB\n\n     Video Card:\n        DirectX(R)9.0c/Shader3.0 compatible with at least 256MB of video RAM\n        - NVIDIA(R) GeForce(R) 7900 series or higher\n        - ATI Radeon(TM) HD 3850 or higher\n\n     Sound Card:\n        DirectX(R)9.0c compatible sound card\n\n     DVD-ROM Drive:\n        DVD9 compatible Drive\n\n     Monitor:\n        800x600 (SVGA) or higher\n\n\n\n\n\n***** enjoy ... *****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b10a7f84d3a051ca35ac58d598c84f296f07491","amp;dn":"PC+-+DARK+VOID+Full+Game+directplay+by+globe%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b10a7f84d3a051ca35ac58d598c84f296f07491","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,16,167,248,77,58,5,28,163,90,197,141,89,140,132,242,150,240,116,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
