Just search for mod again ;)\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION :\r\n1. Unzip file anywhere you want.\r\n2. Read the &quot;READ ME OR YOU WON'T HAVE SOUND.txt&quot; file in the mod's directory.\r\n3. Enjoy the game :P\r\n\r\nSince I can't post links here, search &quot;GTA Mysterious Mod&quot; in youtube and you'll see two videos from the very early stages of development from around 2 years ago. Some things are gone, new ones are added, so don't expect everything from videos to be in-game. I might make newer videos but to be honest I'm too lazy at the moment :D\r\nIf someone makes videos about all things in the mod, please share a comment with the link here so everyone can check them out X)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e3ca4a2d30fea78dca0cb296a14496429be8868","amp;dn":"GTA+Mysterious+Mod+%282011-2015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e3ca4a2d30fea78dca0cb296a14496429be8868","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,60,164,162,211,15,234,120,220,160,203,41,106,20,73,100,41,190,136,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
