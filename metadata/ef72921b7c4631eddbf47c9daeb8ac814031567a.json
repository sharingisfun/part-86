Their sophomore release delivers the promise of the first one, and we\r\ncan only be sad that it took four years to hear them again on record.\r\n\r\nSome tracks are very short, built around composed ideas, quite inventive, and\r\nfull of open and unexpected interactions, others are longer, such as the albums\r\ncenterpiece, &quot;Foliage Misconstrued&quot;, which is a nervous, angular, intense\r\nseventeen minute workout, with all three instruments giving their best in a\r\ncomplex dynamic that is both physical and lyrical, full of contradictions and\r\ninherent tension that suddenly turns into a slow eery soundscape, full of dark\r\nrumblings and distant scraping.\r\n\r\nOn &quot;Chitin&quot;, the extended techniques reign to create an ominous atmosphere of\r\nfragility and vulnerability, hesitating to see how far sounds can be stretched\r\nbefore they burst. &quot;Mobiliar&quot; brings us a percussion-heavy almost boppish intro\r\nthat shapeshifts into a calmer, refreshing, middle section, then shapeshifting\r\nagain into an open improvisation with percussive hits on drums and piano\r\ncreating a context for Landfermann's bass to demonstrate sonic pecularities.\r\n\r\nThe music leads you in many directions, of nervous agitation, playful boppish\r\ntreats, calm precision and avant-garde explorations into the nature of sonic\r\ninteraction, and most often all in the same track.\r\n\r\nAgain, three outstanding musicians who bring us some of the best piano bass\r\ndrums music around.\r\n\r\nDon't miss either of these albums. The next equally strong album piano trio we\r\ncan look forward to is Roil with Raft Of The Meadows, but that trio will be\r\nreviewed by a colleague.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Grego Applegate Edwards\r\n\r\nBy Marek Lubner (pl/en)\r\n\r\nDoor Henning Bolte (nl) \nhttp://www.writteninmusic.com/jazz/grunen-pith-twig/\r\n\r\nPor Cayetano LÃ³pez (es)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef72921b7c4631eddbf47c9daeb8ac814031567a","amp;dn":"Grunen+-+Pith+%26amp%3B+Twig+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef72921b7c4631eddbf47c9daeb8ac814031567a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,114,146,27,124,70,49,237,219,244,124,157,174,184,172,129,64,49,86,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
