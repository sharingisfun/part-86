Recorded in Omaha, Nebraska after the pair relocated to the U.S., it was produced by Mike Mogis, whoâ€™s also produced for the likes of Jenny Lewis, First Aid Kit, Bright Eyes, and M. Ward.\r\nWith Kirwin and Rudston-Brown sharing songwriting duties and trading lead vocals, the album features string arrangements from Tony Buchen â€” the producer behind the bandâ€™s first EP, Hollywood,\r\nAmid folkier entries, the upbeat â€œSummerâ€ plays like â€™60s AM pop, â€œBetter Way to Goâ€ issues alt-country, and the lead single, â€œLet the Light In,â€ features Kirwinâ€™s melancholy vocals with atmospheric strings and gentle reverberation for a swirling ballad.\r\nRating 8/10\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n1. Let In The Light\r\n2. Summer\r\n3. Beating Hearts\r\n4. Thatâ€™s The Thing\r\n5. Someone Like You\r\n6. Falling\r\n7. When We Were Young\r\n8. Independence Day\r\n9. Better Way To Go\r\n10.
