Kennedy Montgomery is a libertarian that you may recognize from 90's MTV, Stossel, and the Independents.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nNo episode on the 17th. For reasons.\r\n\r\nThere was no episode on the 17th. Kennedy kicks the night off talking about Hillary's ringing endorsement from her kid Chelsea. Chelsea thinks we just haven't seen enough of Hillary yet. Our party panel is here to discuss. (TOM SHILLUE, JOE DeVITO, KAYLEIGH McENANY) Democratic hopeful Martin o'Malley says there aren't enough debates on the Democratic side. Is the DNC shielding Clinton? Presidential candidate Bobby Jindal has been taking big swings at Donald Trump. Could it revive his campaign, or sink it?\r\n\r\nLast years unrest in Ferguson prompted a lot of interest in police militarization. Some people involved with documentary Peace Officer are in studio to talk. DUB LAWRENCE (former sherrif), SCOTTT CHRISOPHERSON (Peace Officer director), and  BRAD BARDER (also a director of Peace Officer) talk Ferguson, police militarization, Dub's experiences, how to know when a police department has crossed a line, and what can we change. I wish this segment was longer.\r\n\r\nTOPICAL STORM\r\nDizzy doggy\r\nTiny prankster\r\nPumpkin boat\r\nBarista boogie down\r\nDrunk photobomb.\r\n\r\nOur panel is back. First topic - A federal judge has ruled that it's your constitutional first amendment right to drop an f-bomb. Two men in china have tried selling their kidneys to get a shiny new iPhone. People having sex with robots and people being against said sex.\r\n\r\nWinner of American Ninja Warrior ISAAC CALDIERO is here to talk about his taking the Ninja Warrior championship, training, diets, road food, and his million dollar prize.\r\n\r\nNightcap: Kennedy actually agrees with something Obama said. He recently spoke at an Iowa town hall and spoke out against the PC atmosphere on college campuses.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name                            : Kennedy.2015.09.16.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\r\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\r\nCodec ID                                 : isom\r\nFile size                                : 253 MiB\r\nDuration                                 : 42mn 7s\r\nOverall bit rate                         : 839 Kbps\r\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                                       : 1\r\nFormat                                   : AVC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile                           :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration                                 : 42mn 7s\r\nBit rate                                 : 700 Kbps\r\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\r\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\r\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\r\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space                              : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\r\nScan type                                : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.106\r\nStream size                              : 211 MiB (83%)\r\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\r\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=700 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                                       : 2\r\nFormat                                   : AAC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile                           : LC\r\nCodec ID                                 : 40\r\nDuration                                 : 42mn 7s\r\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\r\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\r\nStream size                              : 38.6 MiB (15%)\r\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:095985551a0b6067751a987fa07f232b969e5a04","amp;dn":"Kennedy.2015.09.16.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"095985551a0b6067751a987fa07f232b969e5a04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,89,133,85,26,11,96,103,117,26,152,127,160,127,35,43,150,158,90,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
