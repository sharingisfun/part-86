The real reason it was removed was because the app interfered with Google's ads business - Google weren't making much money because the app blocks all ads not only from Google, but also their affiliates and other ads networks.\r\n\r\nSchÃ¼rmann no longer release an Android package (APK) for AdAway, but he still participate in its development. You can find AdAway source codes at https://github.com/dschuermann/ad-away. You can download the source codes in your IDE and build your own AdAway app if you wish.\r\n\r\nThe AdAway Android package included in this torrent was built by F-Droid. You can find them at https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.adaway.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\nPrerequisite requirement:\r\n--------------------------\r\n1.
