Since its in a standard ISO format it can be burned on any blank DVD with any burning software program, or you can mount it in any computer (such as PowerISO)\n\nNothing has been stripped from this DVD...I don't to deprive people of those awesome special features to just have improve the video and audio that some people do (I don't see a difference anyway)...\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a435c6e1157c3664740b13c0c6959297dfd70729","amp;dn":"Dumb+%26+Dumber+%281994%29+Unrated.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a435c6e1157c3664740b13c0c6959297dfd70729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,53,198,225,21,124,54,100,116,11,19,192,198,149,146,151,223,215,7,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
