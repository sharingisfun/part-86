His rejection, early in his career, of 'peinture pure' led him to develop forms of artistic creation 'beyond painting' (as he put it), which were instrumental in defining the scope of Surrealist art, and which established him as a pioneer Surrealist.\nConsidered the 'complete Surrealist' because of his mastery of the techniques of  automatism and of illusionism. Max Ernst must also be regarded as one of the most significant of modern European painters, and the creator of some of the most compelling images of our era.\nHis lasting achievement has been to enlarge our horizons, both mental and artistic, and to add a moral dimension to the idea of art as exploration","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b16f6df99a3b950c8a593d581fdbef98ff02b60","amp;dn":"Max+Ernst+%28Phaidon+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b16f6df99a3b950c8a593d581fdbef98ff02b60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,22,246,223,153,163,185,80,200,165,147,213,129,253,190,249,143,240,43,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
