Who is Man? Why do we search for meaning? Their journey brings them into the middle of the lives of the homeless on the streets of New York City, the orphans and disabled children of Peru, and the abandoned lepers in the forests of Ghana, Africa. What the young men discover changes them forever. Through one on one interviews and real life encounters, the brothers are awakened to the beauty of the human person and the resilience of the human spirit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dbe474fe8297f3f9865fe11c78defc62fe2f8bb","amp;dn":"The.Human.Experience.2008.720p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H264-FGT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dbe474fe8297f3f9865fe11c78defc62fe2f8bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,190,71,79,232,41,127,63,152,101,254,17,199,141,239,198,47,226,248,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
