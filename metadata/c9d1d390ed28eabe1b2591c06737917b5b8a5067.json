Their signatures are poetic lyrics and guitar solos.\n\nThe band debuted in 1976, when it was founded in Liepaja by Eriks Kigelis and Juris Pavitols. They started out as a pop-rock band and played in various gigs around Latvia, whilst trying to find their own specific style. Thus the period of 1977-1985 was largely a chaotic time in the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it varied from pretty pop to heavy rock. But one thing never changed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ their anti-soviet propaganda, their patriotism and their monumentalism.\n\nAfter the death of Livi leader Eriks Kigelis in 1986, Ainars Virga joined the band, thus starting a new era ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the era of anthemic ballads, hard hitting heavy rock tunes and rebellious philosophy. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C4%ABvi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C4%ABvi&lt;/a&gt;\n\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9d1d390ed28eabe1b2591c06737917b5b8a5067","amp;dn":"L%C3%84%C2%ABvi+-+P%C3%84%C2%81ri+Visam+2004+%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9d1d390ed28eabe1b2591c06737917b5b8a5067","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,209,211,144,237,40,234,190,27,37,145,192,103,55,145,123,91,138,80,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
