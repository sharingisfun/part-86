M, Law &amp; Order SVU (maybe on Wednesday, depends on Canadian airing), Human Target as MP4 H264; ~3.48 MB/minute\nFriday:  30 R as 360p, GreyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A., The Mentalist, Fringe as MP4 H264; ~3.48 MB/minute \nSaturday: Dollhouse as 360p (MP4 H264)\nSunday:  Legend o.t.S. as MP4 H264; ~3.48 MB/minute, re-seed of week's episodes\nMonday:  Desp.H (this Monday S08E1-E2 of 24 and Human Target pilot), Being Human as MP4 H264; ~3.48 MB/minute\nDouble-episodes, requests or Pilot ep. will be issued only as MP4 or 360p.\nMP4 is ISO 14496-1(H264 video &amp; AAC LC sound) and playable on PCs, Macs and hopefully (read Comment before download; I check every file for iTunes compliance) on iPod-like portable-mobile devices.\n360p is fully compatible with newer iPod, iTouch and Nokia U97. \nRequests should be posted in Comments section of newest torrents.\n&quot;Out of schedule&quot; shows or pilot-episodes may get uploaded randomly, if situation arise (free slots).\n\nI recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:585cf2e3da34c922f7cee1a96598c8fc892cc908","amp;dn":"24.S08E01.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"585cf2e3da34c922f7cee1a96598c8fc892cc908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,92,242,227,218,52,201,34,247,206,225,169,101,152,200,252,137,44,201,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
