I invite everyone to watch it and to ask questions at 1-700-509-209 or at www.kab.tv/eng\n\n&quot;We influence Nature (the Creator) with the power of our thoughts. This is how we intervene in the Plan of our development, and in return we receive the same influence we caused and altered.\n\nIf all of us together direct our thoughts toward goodness, we will change our fate. Right now every person thinks in his own favor, against others; therefore, our thoughts donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t converge into one, good thought, but evoke mutually destructive consequences.\n\nIn other words, NatureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (the CreatorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s) Plan for our development is neutral in and of itself. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s us who improve and accelerate, or, on the contrary, delay and worsen Its influence on us with our desires, thoughts, and intentions. Our entire choice lies in choosing which path to take: the short and good path, or the lengthy and evil one&quot;\n\nRav Michael Laitman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c80773f37e25dfa9d55c9ad907b58eeaf803aa99","amp;dn":"Free+Kabbalah+-+Michael+Laitman+-+Ask+the+Kabbalist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c80773f37e25dfa9d55c9ad907b58eeaf803aa99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,7,115,243,126,37,223,169,213,92,154,217,7,181,142,234,248,3,170,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
