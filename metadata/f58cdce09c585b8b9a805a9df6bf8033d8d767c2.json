Set in Roman times, the play deals with the bloody revenge of \nRoman general Titus Andronicus for the atrocities committed against his \nfamily by Tamora, the captive queen of the Goths, and her faction. \n\nMy notes\n\nThis fileshare from the Globe series is considerably smaller and therefore \nmore accessible than others I've made.  This Titus should \nencourage libraries and individuals to acquire all in the series in their \noriginal and annotated DVD form.\n\nI've seen the Ambrose/BBC Titus and the Julie Taymor film of the play as \nwell.  But perhaps of most current interest is the revival of the Grand Guinol (Big Puppet) theatre style.  Unlike the name implies it was the most extreme form of stage display of violence and gore in modern \ntimes.  And it is referenced in the current dramatic television series \n&quot;Penny Dreadful.&quot;   Another television note is that Indra Varma appears as \nTamora whom some will recognize from the series &quot;Rome&quot; of a few years ago.\n\nTo give away more would spoil the experience but you will find that the live audience reactions to the play are unique.\n\n\n\nNotes written  September 22, 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f58cdce09c585b8b9a805a9df6bf8033d8d767c2","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%27s+Globe+On+Screen+Titus+Andronicus+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f58cdce09c585b8b9a805a9df6bf8033d8d767c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,140,220,224,156,88,91,139,154,128,90,157,246,191,128,51,216,215,103,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
