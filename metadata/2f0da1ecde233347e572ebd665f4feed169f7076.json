So if you like this torrent, go buy the CD proper! \n\n\n\n&quot;Grey Life, StoeckleinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lone solo record, released by Dot Records in 1968 to little acclaim or success. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the kind of record you might buy for 50 cents because the coverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a guy dressed entirely in black, sitting in the corner of what appears to be a padded room, playing his guitarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½has an elegant simplicity that suggests something worth hearing. Turns out it contains something even more unlikely: 11 achingly sad acoustic songs accompanied by immaculate, over-the-top orchestral arrangements, like an extremely depressed Neil Diamond or Burt Bacharach arranging Smog. It ranges from quiet, finger-picked melancholia (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSounds of YesterdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) to baroque pop melancholia (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMorning ChildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) to something approaching majestic (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSeven Days Away From You,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which, by the way, your life is not complete without hearing), all topped by a self-consciously slick voice that sounds a few seconds shy of total collapse. It is, in short, amazing.&quot;\n\nFrom &quot;Sad and Gone: The Story of Val Stoecklein's Grey Life, the Best Album You Never Heard&quot; http://www.citypaper.com/music/story.asp?id=9480\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f0da1ecde233347e572ebd665f4feed169f7076","amp;dn":"Val+Stoecklein+%28Blue+Things%29+Grey+Life+%281968+album%29+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f0da1ecde233347e572ebd665f4feed169f7076","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,13,161,236,222,35,51,71,229,114,235,214,101,244,254,237,22,159,112,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
