Quinho (Ãƒâ€šngelo Paes Leme) has always been jealous of his father's predilection for his foster brother and forges his own kidnapping in order to extort the father. Dante mobilizes himself aiming to rescue the brother, however he finds out the simulation before being arrested.\n\nSeven years later, Dante is back home when he notices that his wife Luana (Aline Fanju) is married with Quinho and that everything in home and in family business is now completely different. These facts awaken his thirst after revenge against those that have prejudiced his life. \n\nThis production has not been registered at IMDB and shall not be confused with some movies or international TV Series that, in Brazil, have also received the name &quot;Acerto de Contas&quot;, such as:\n\n- Blood of Redemption (2013), tt2510268\n- Wrong Turn at Tahoe (2009), tt1393000\n- Leverage (2008), tt1103987\n- L'Anniversaire (2005), tt0455078\n- Keys to Tulsa (1997), tt0116762\n- The Big Easy (1986), tt0092654\n- Deadbeat (1977), tt0074379","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc71124f0e085772b27567af30cc8973008c683b","amp;dn":"Acerto.De.Contas.S01.2014.WEB-DL.720p.Startler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc71124f0e085772b27567af30cc8973008c683b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,113,18,79,14,8,87,114,178,117,103,175,48,204,137,115,0,140,104,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
