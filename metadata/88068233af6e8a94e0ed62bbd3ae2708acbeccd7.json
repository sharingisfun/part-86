Kletz, Paul Amyotte (CRC, 2010).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781439804551\r\n\r\nHow far will an ounce of prevention really go? While the answer to that question may never be truly known, Process Plants: A Handbook for Inherently Safer Design, Second Edition takes us several steps closer. The book demonstrates not just the importance of prevention, but the importance of designing with prevention in mind. It emphasizes the role of inherent safety in process safety management systems and in ensuring an appropriate process safety culture. Keeping the easy to understand style that made the first edition so popular, this book clearly delineates practical, everyday issues and complex technical ones.\r\n\r\nThe second edition provides:\r\n\r\nCoverage of new inherent safety metrics and how to measure the degree or level of inherent safety\r\nNew examples of application of the various principles of inherently safer design and 20 new figures\r\nNew emphasis on the role of inherently safer design in process safety management systems and in ensuring an appropriate process safety culture\r\nDiscussion of dust explosion risk reduction by means of inherently safer approaches\r\nNew chapter on case study development, providing a comprehensive approach to the prevention and mitigation of process incidents by timely incorporation of inherently safer design\r\nThis updated version of a classic text examines how to incorporate inherently safer design into process industry activities, revising and updating information based on recent research and developments. A how-to resource at its core, the book includes numerous examples that illustrate the principles of inherently safer design and how to apply them in practice. It explains how to measure the inherent safeness of a process, referencing metric tools that have been developed during the past decade and the tried and true methods that have become industry stand bys","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88068233af6e8a94e0ed62bbd3ae2708acbeccd7","amp;dn":"Process+Plants+-+A+Handbook+for+Inherently+Safer+Design+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88068233af6e8a94e0ed62bbd3ae2708acbeccd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,6,130,51,175,110,138,148,224,237,98,187,211,174,39,8,172,190,204,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
