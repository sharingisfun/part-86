The four songs on Cardamom Times are the follow up to her acclaimed album The Innocents from last year and continue to find her in the folk hinterland, a strange mish mash of Nicoâ€™s Desert Shore, Judy Henskeâ€™s Farewell Aldebaran and Joanna Newsomâ€™s strangeness.\r\nIf this were a slice of vintage vinyl on some obscure label from the early seventies it would surely be worth a mint. As it is Mering delivers four songs backed by acoustic guitar, wind instruments and spectral keyboards with her voice soaked in echo adding an otherworldly feel. In fact the underworld, a cold and forbidding underground cathedral extending into eternity would be an appropriate setting for the EPâ€™s lengthy centrepiece, â€œTake You There.â€ Here Mering intones over an organ like sound (manipulated methinks) summoning up a feel not dissimilar to Gavin Bryarsâ€™ Jesus Never Failed Me Yet. Itâ€™s chilling and chillingly addictive but is soon dispelled by the dappled folk delivery of â€œCardamom,â€ a song that truly recalls bucolic folk from the sixties. Thereâ€™s more psych folk on â€œIn The Beginningâ€ and again itâ€™s a beguiling song; more layered than its predecessors it hums and throbs with that peculiar mix of woodland mythology and folk knowledge that marked out many of the artists who populate Rob Youngâ€™s book, Electric Eden. Perfect music for entertaining Ents and Elves.\r\nRating 9/10\r\n\r\nimage\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01 - Maybe Love.flac\r\n02 - Take You There.flac\r\n03 - Cardamom.flac\r\n04 - In The Beginning.flac\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nGenre: Indie-Folk\r\nCountry: USA\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~744-839 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db2e9dafeba90075f7a901f272859716caa365f8","amp;dn":"%282015%29+Weyes+Blood+-+Cardamom+Times+%28EP%29+%5BFLAC%2CTracks%5D+%7B100.XY%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db2e9dafeba90075f7a901f272859716caa365f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,46,157,175,235,169,0,117,247,169,1,242,114,133,151,22,202,163,101,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
