As they say if you so wind, you will reap whirlwind. Based on such a ingenious premise Bhaag Johnny goes for its marathon run. \r\n\r\nJanardan Arora aka Johnny (Kunal Khemu) is away from home in Bangkok to earn livelihood. His mother is a worried lot back home for irregular contact with Johnny. She shows his astrological chart to one Acharya who predicts that Johnnyâ€™s life is in danger. He suggests a remedy through  positive Tantra  mediation. Johnny gets trapped by her employer Ramona ( Zoa Morani) for doing insider trading. She threatens him with jail term if he does not toe her line. \r\n\r\nRamona gives him a task of wooing one girl Tanaya (Mandana Karimi). Johnny is all game for such a task. But when he is told that now he has to kill the girl, Johnny refuses as he is not a murderer. He is in a dilemma. At this juncture a Jinn (Vikram Bhatt with his natural wig of white,dishevlled hair) appears. Jinn offers him a way out. He has two choices. Either to kill Tanaya or save her. He will have to lead two lives. Whatever is the outcome, he will have to choose the one he likes and that will be his destiny. \r\n\r\nThe whole story thereafter is how Johnny leads two scenarios and is on the run from Ramona and a hindi speaking crime branch sleuth Insp Khan (Mukul Dev) with ponytail and overcoat trying to crack the â€˜nutâ€™case . What are the consequences of both these lives is the rest of the plot. Towards the end Ramonaâ€™s motive is known.And Jinn asks Johnny which path he prefers. Of course, Johnny opts for the righteous one. \r\n\r\nSo much fuss for such a preposterous plot.Written by the horror specialist Vikram Bhatt the movie instead of giving the audience run for his ticket money, goes round in circles with car,mobike,boat chases, hand-fights and bone-crunching, glass shattering standard action sequences, ill-timed songs and over-all bland performances by everyone, mark everyone. \r\n\r\nThen this appearance and disappearance of a Jinn that makes you ponder to run out of the theatre.One wonders how Super Cassettes T Series backed this ill-conceived project. \r\n\r\nIn this cross-cutting narrative of two parallel scenarios,director Shivamm Nair (Of Ahista Ahista fame) has nothing unique to offer. You will have to rely on the good old nail-cutter to pair your nails instead of getting an opportunity to go for a manicure in a nail-biting thriller. \r\n\r\nIts very title reminds you of Tim Tykwerâ€™s Run Lola Run that pushed the boundaries of cinematic language in its thrilling telling of a two line story. Thank Heavens the similarity just ends with just a semblance to the title. Bhaag Johnny gives you all the reasons to play truant at the Box Office and run to some safe place because here if you sow expectations you will  surely reap frustration. \r\n\r\nInfo:\r\n\r\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 \r\nFormat profile              : Base Media \r\nCodec ID                    : isom \r\nFile size                   : 317 MiB \r\nDuration                    : 1h 53mn \r\nOverall bit rate mode       : Variable \r\nOverall bit rate            : 391 Kbps \r\nWriting application         : Lavf56.40.101 \r\n\r\nVideo \r\nID                          : 1 \r\nFormat                      : AVC \r\nFormat/Info                 : Advanced Video Codec \r\nFormat profile              :    \r\nFormat settings, CABAC      : Yes \r\nFormat settings, ReFrames   : 5 frames \r\nCodec ID                    : avc1 \r\nCodec ID/Info               : Advanced Video Coding \r\nDuration                    : 1h 53mn \r\nBit rate                    : 304 Kbps \r\nWidth                       : 440 pixels \r\nHeight                      : 360 pixels \r\nDisplay aspect ratio        : 16:9 \r\nFrame rate mode             : Constant \r\nFrame rate                  : 25.000 fps \r\nColor space                 : YUV \r\nChroma subsampling          : 4:2:0 \r\nBit depth                   : 8 bits \r\nScan type                   : Progressive \r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.077 \r\nStream size                 : 247 MiB (78%) \r\nWriting library             : x264 core 142 r2479 dd79a61 \r\nEncoding settings           : cabac=1 / ref=5 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x113 / me=umh / subme=8 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=12 / lookahead_threads=2 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=2 / b_bias=0 / direct=3 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=50 / rc=crf / mbtree=1 / crf=22.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=0 / qpmax=69 / qpstep=4 / vbv_maxrate=800 / vbv_bufsize=1600 / crf_max=0.0 / nal_hrd=none / filler=0 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00 \r\n\r\nAudio \r\nID                          : 2 \r\nFormat                      : AAC \r\nFormat/Info                 : Advanced Audio Codec \r\nFormat profile              : LC \r\nCodec ID                    : 40 \r\nDuration                    : 1h 53mn \r\nBit rate mode               : Variable \r\nBit rate                    : 80.0 Kbps \r\nMaximum bit rate            : 800 Kbps \r\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels \r\nChannel positions           : Front: L R \r\nSampling rate               : 44.1 KHz \r\nCompression mode            : Lossy \r\nStream size                 : 64.9 MiB (20%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f123389cdf3f0ba39b96e4aa7df1c5f376ab2461","amp;dn":"Bhaag+Johnny+2015+Hindi+TS+AAC-SSM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f123389cdf3f0ba39b96e4aa7df1c5f376ab2461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,35,56,156,223,63,11,163,155,150,228,170,125,241,197,243,118,171,36,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
