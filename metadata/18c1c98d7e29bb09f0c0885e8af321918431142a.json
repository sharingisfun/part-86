The author offers detailed accounts of how killers travel a path that leads from childhood innocence to lethal violence in adolescence or adulthood. He places the emotional and moral damage of each individual killer within a larger scientific framework of social, psychological, anthropological, and biological research on human development. By linking individual cases to broad social and cultural issues and illustrating the social toxicity and unresolved trauma that drive some people to kill, Dr. Garbarino highlights the humanity we share with killers and the role of understanding and empathy in breaking the cycle of violence","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18c1c98d7e29bb09f0c0885e8af321918431142a","amp;dn":"Listening+to+Killers+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18c1c98d7e29bb09f0c0885e8af321918431142a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,193,201,141,126,41,187,9,240,192,136,94,138,243,33,145,132,49,20,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
