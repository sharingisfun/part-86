This broadcast's first two hours are to focus primarily on Cass Sunstein, Obama's &quot;Info-Czar&quot; [Director of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs] and his ideas about internet regulation and censorship, taxing or outlawing conspiracy theorists, the 2nd Amendment, etc., etc..\n\n\nI am including in this torrent a .pdf copy of Sunstein's article, &quot;Conspiracy Theories.&quot;\n\nHere's a quote from an OpEd piece he wrote some years ago for the Chicago Tribune:\n\n&quot;In what sense in the money in our pockets and bank accounts \nfully ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“oursÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢? Did we earn it by our own autonomous efforts? \nCould we have inherited it without the assistance of probate \ncourts? Do we save it without the support of bank regulators? \nCould we spend it if there were no public officials to \ncoordinate the efforts and pool the resources of the \ncommunity in which we live? [....] Without taxes there would \nbe no liberty. Without taxes there would be no property. \nWithout taxes, few of us would have any assets worth \ndefending. [....] There is no liberty without dependency. \nThat is why we should celebrate tax day....&quot;\n\n\n\nIn the 3rd hour, Jason talks with Cindy Sheehan.\n\nHe also takes a number of calls.\n\n\n\n\n]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[\n\nPlease be aware that someone is anonymously uploading \ntorrents to The Pirate Bay that duplicate my torrent\nnames and copy-paste my descriptions.\n\nAn example is here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5285597/Alex_Jones_Show_-_2010_Jan_15_FR_%5Bsebaygo1%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5285597/Alex_Jones_Show_-_2010_Jan_15_FR_%5Bsebaygo1%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTHESE ARE NOT MINE AND I HAVE NO IDEA \nWHAT THEY MAY CONTAIN!!!\n\nIf you have any doubt about whether a torrent is \nlegitimately one of mine, please go here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/sebaygo1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/sebaygo1/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThank you.\n\n]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[]-[\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
