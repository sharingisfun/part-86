The tool uses the winapp2.ini system built into CCleaner to easily add new rules and definitions for programs. The rules were sourced mainly from the Piriform Support Forum, with several sourced from other places around the internet. Directly download the winapp2.ini file.\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\nThe actual file containing the definitions is not included with the program, but is instead downloaded by the program. Simply press â€˜Download Latestâ€™ and the tool will automatically download the most recent version of the definitions. If CCEnhancer cannot locate the CCleaner.exe file you can open a dialog box and select the page yourself.\r\n\r\nWhen used correctly, you should see more programs appear in the CCleaner menu.\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\nâ€“ http://content.thewebatom.net/ &amp; CCEnhancer.exe may need to be added to your firewall &amp; antivirus ignore list.\r\n\r\nâ€“ Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.\r\nâ€“ Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10\r\nâ€“ You may need to use â€œRun as Administratorâ€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08b58be5c52d548ea55936e3912a7c71b659bbaf","amp;dn":"CCEnhancer+4.3+for+CCleaner+Multi+Language","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08b58be5c52d548ea55936e3912a7c71b659bbaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,181,139,229,197,45,84,142,165,89,54,227,145,42,124,113,182,89,187,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
