This is a HUGE torrent.  Please do NOT JOIN this swarm if you can not download at decent speeds.\r\n\r\nSee text file torrent for the contents and revue before downloading this.  You may not want the tracks contained here.   This is a whole collection, over 300 GB and will take 4 months or more and many parts to get out via bit torrent.\r\n\r\nPLEASE DO NOT HIT AND RUN.   THIS IS A 16 Gigabyte sized download in many parts.  If you have no idea what impact this will have on your bandwidth or social life, then perhaps this is not for you.\r\n\r\nOnce I have a few good peers, I will use SUPER SEEDING/Initial Seeding to help ease the load on my server.  Read up about that if you wish, but I will not show as a seed but a fellow peer.   Don't forget to check both UDP and TCP ports are open and you can upload to the swarm.  The better you can manage your upload speed to this swarm the FASTER you will download.\r\n\r\nPart 2 and the letter B to follow once this is well seeded.\r\n\r\nRigmar Radio - Seeding to the World since 2003","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fefd1c69758fef3c2284cb4f1817c18af2d5f3eb","amp;dn":"Rigmar+Radio+Karaoke+Collection+Part+1+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fefd1c69758fef3c2284cb4f1817c18af2d5f3eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,253,28,105,117,143,239,60,34,132,203,79,24,23,193,138,242,213,243,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
