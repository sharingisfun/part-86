Interviews with Matt Hasselbeck, Andre Johnson, Frank Gore.  Also, short press conference with Houston Texans head coach regarding his QB controversy and whether Ryan Mallett will be the starter or Choke King Brian Hoyer!\r\n\r\n\r\nGood for Matt Hasselbeck. I'm a Seahawks fan and it's always good to see Matt do well.  It's also nice to see how Andre Johnson, who was cut by Houston, can come &quot;home&quot; and SHOVE IT UP THE TEXAN'S ASSES WITH TWO TOUCHDOWNS AND A WIN FOR HIS NEW TEAM THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS.\r\n\r\nThe last bit of this video is about the new Mazda Miata MX-5 convertible.  I have 3 Miatas and am a huge enthusiast.  If you don't like the Mazda Miata.....FUCK YOU!\r\n\r\nLove always,\r\n\r\nCody","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6190a1fc147d25647a9e926d69250e4d8bf4934","amp;dn":"NFL.2015-10-08.MNF.Post.Game.Show.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6190a1fc147d25647a9e926d69250e4d8bf4934","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,25,10,31,193,71,210,86,71,169,233,38,214,146,80,228,216,191,73,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
