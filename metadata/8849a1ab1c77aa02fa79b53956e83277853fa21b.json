The Delta Pi sorority is clamouring to put together a monumental bash in order to commemorate the annual marathon of debauchery and they are so intently focused on their fiesta, that even the killings that have occurred close to their college could not deter them from the celebration. While the party cements itself around a large bonfire it just wouldn't be a sorority soiree without a good natured prank on one of the lesser pledges, and when that prank goes horribly awry, things only get worse when another sizeable set of murders occur while help is trying to be obtained for the toasted co-ed.\r\n\r\nWe transport ourselves some 28 years into the future, and the memory of that horrific night is still fresh in the mind of one woman, who is readying her own daughter, Diana, for her collegiate career at Mom's alma mater - see where this is going? We've got ourselves a recipe for a revenge styled slay-a-thon.\r\n\r\nThis flick boasts a rather impressive body count. Also, the special effects are decent and worked just enough to pull off the kill gags. Overall, Die Die Delta Pi is a modern slasher that has style and bloodshed. This is a slow burner but the great gore and beautiful women more than make up for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x412, 29.970 fps, 1493 kbps, 01h18m46s\r\nAudio: AAC, 48000 Hz, stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/9ru90lky1/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/dfr1x6rbx/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/j2neuntul/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/xkkm2nl5p/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/utvpumrn9/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8849a1ab1c77aa02fa79b53956e83277853fa21b","amp;dn":"Die+Die+Delta+Pi+%282013+-+USA%29+slasher+horror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8849a1ab1c77aa02fa79b53956e83277853fa21b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,73,161,171,28,119,170,2,250,121,181,57,86,232,50,119,133,63,162,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
