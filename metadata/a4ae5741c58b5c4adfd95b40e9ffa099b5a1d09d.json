In this show, the trades come together to build homes for two former soldiers who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and are suffering from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), before also helping them to find new careers in the building trade.\r\n\r\nBut with numbers of volunteers lower than what's needed and the buildings proving trickier than anticipated, it's turning into the toughest build yet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4ae5741c58b5c4adfd95b40e9ffa099b5a1d09d","amp;dn":"DIY.SOS.s26e07.EN.SUB.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4ae5741c58b5c4adfd95b40e9ffa099b5a1d09d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,174,87,65,197,139,92,74,223,217,91,64,233,255,160,153,181,161,208,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
