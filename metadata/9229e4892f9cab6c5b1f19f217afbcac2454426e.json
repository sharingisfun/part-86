Departing from the mini-game centric action of previous Rabbids games, Rabbids Go Home features open-world style mission gameplay centered around the Rabbids harebrained scheme to get to the moon. In true Rabbids form this entails over-the-top single player and multiplayer gameplay built around creating a pile made up of everyday and not so everyday items stolen from the consumer-crazed humans of planet Earth, that is literally tall enough to reach the edge of space.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9229e4892f9cab6c5b1f19f217afbcac2454426e","amp;dn":"Rabbids+Go+Home+%5BPAL%5D+%5BWiiTorrentZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9229e4892f9cab6c5b1f19f217afbcac2454426e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,41,228,137,47,156,171,108,91,31,25,242,23,175,188,172,36,84,66,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
