Most torrent sites do not like torrents with thousands of files, and because each file is in fact 2 files, one MP3 and one CDG it is a problem, for uploading 600 songs is in fact 1200 files.\r\n\r\nPart one track listing is enclosed as a text file suitable for import into the speadsheet of your choice for printing Karaoke books.\r\n\r\nI don't want to ZIP or RAR them as that causes some users problems as well, so I will split the entire collection into 1GB or so chunks and get it out that way.\r\n\r\nCDG+MP3 Karaoke correctly file named and tagged for playback from a Laptop.  Now features multiple choice for Karaoke Label on the more popular tracks.  Enjoy.\r\n\r\nRigmar Radio - Seeding to the World since 2004.  \r\n\r\nOH AND a big THANKS TO USER ROFFE who cross posted my seeds over here when I could not post","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dea5afb5e2cd6920e1cd85db1285f007ba0483a","amp;dn":"Rigmar+Radio+Karaoke+Part+1A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dea5afb5e2cd6920e1cd85db1285f007ba0483a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,234,90,251,94,44,214,146,14,28,216,93,177,40,95,0,123,160,72,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
