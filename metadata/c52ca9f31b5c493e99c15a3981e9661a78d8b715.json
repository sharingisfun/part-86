For this reason, Francis Stoessel adopts a unique systematic how-to-do approach: Each chapter begins with a case history illustrating the topic and presenting the lessons learned from the incident. In so doing, he analyzes a goldmine of numerous examples stemming from industrial practice, additionally providing a series of problems or case studies at the end of each chapter. Divided into three distinct sections, part one looks at the general aspects of thermal process safety, while Part 2 deals with mastering exothermal reactions. The final section discusses the avoidance of secondary reactions, including heat accumulation and thermal confinement","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c52ca9f31b5c493e99c15a3981e9661a78d8b715","amp;dn":"Thermal+Safety+of+Chemical+Processes+-+Risk+Assessment+and+Proce","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c52ca9f31b5c493e99c15a3981e9661a78d8b715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,44,169,243,27,92,73,62,153,193,90,57,129,233,102,26,120,216,183,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
