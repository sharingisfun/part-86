In Australia some of the most bizarre to roam the earth existed including a giant wombat, a huge\nkangaroo, a massive lizard and the earth's biggest flightless bird. For hundreds of thousands of years these were the heavy weight champions of the animal kingdom.\n\nBut suddenly, inexplicably they vanished. Something happened which wiped them off the face of the planet forever.\n\nWhile there have been several mass extinctions of large terrestrial animals throughout history, the death of Australia's megafauna is relatively recent. It occurred less than 60,000 years ago and no one knows why. It remains one of\nthe longest running and hotly argued debates in palaeontology. For decades scientific sleuths from around the world have been trying to solve the mystery.\n\nNow in a unique corner of the world, a team of top scientists from around the world attempt to crack one of scienceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most enduring mysteries - what killed the megafauna in Australia? Their discoveries could not only help solve the mystery but\nalso offer insight into environmental problems which threaten the world and all life today.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e410e28561533f6d39d2bf348c9d15eab7681631","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Death.Of.The.Megabeasts.2009.DVDRip.XviD-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e410e28561533f6d39d2bf348c9d15eab7681631","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,16,226,133,97,83,63,109,57,210,191,52,140,157,21,234,183,104,22,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
