J. S. van Boekel (CRC, 2009).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN: 9781574446142\r\n\r\nThe level of quality that food maintains as it travels down the production-to-consumption path is largely determined by the chemical, biochemical, physical, and microbiological changes that take place during its processing and storage. Authored by an internationally respected food quality expert, Kinetic Modeling of Reactions in Foods demonstrates how to effectively capture these changes in an integrative fashion using mathematical models. Thus, kinetic modeling of food changes creates the possibility to control and predict food quality from a technological point of view.\r\n\r\nIllustrating how kinetic modeling can predict and control food quality from farm to fork, this authoritative resource:\r\n\r\nApplies kinetic models using general chemical, physical, and biochemical principles\r\nIntroduces Bayesian statistics in kinetic modeling, virtually unchartered territory in the food science field\r\nIntegrates food science, kinetics, and statistics to predict and control food quality attributes using computer models\r\nUses real-world examples rather than hypothetical data to illustrate concepts\r\nThis essential reference is an indispensable guide to understanding all aspects of kinetic food modeling. Unlike many other kinetic volumes available, this book opens the door to the many untapped research opportunities in the food science realm where mathematical modeling can be applied","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06ab2bac823c113455a7a0141a9ebe310a8f947e","amp;dn":"Kinetic+Modeling+of+Reactions+In+Foods","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06ab2bac823c113455a7a0141a9ebe310a8f947e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,171,43,172,130,60,17,52,85,167,160,20,26,158,190,49,10,143,148,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
