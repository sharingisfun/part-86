Current events, politics, news and anything can and will be discussed with celebrity guests and comedians stopping by as well. This show is not for those who are inclined to be &quot;politically correct&quot; and will contain boundary-pushing language and topics. Proceed with caution...\r\n\r\nGuests: Dennis Hof\r\n\r\nEpisode 246: TACS begins today with a recap of yesterdayâ€™s guests, Ant talks about train riding, his knuckles (the fuck?), Lamar Odom, throbbing hard-ons, and last nightâ€™s democratic debate. We watch an anti-Hillary â€œBenghazi video,â€ read the latest on Daniel Craig, learn about Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s racism, Spike Lee being an asshole as usual, Ant writes hashtags for Nancy Grace, talks about Playboy skipping the nudes, admits he fucked up with the DEA, and we hear about Antâ€™s interview with Chalaire. Pimp ass mofo Dennis Hof calls in to talk about Lamar Odomâ€™s whoopsie at the Moonlite BunnyRanch, his possible drug use/herbal supplements, others having â€œissuesâ€ while at the Ranch, and getting the V.I.P treatment. Jocktober (or is it Cocktober??) makes an appearance with â€œCory &amp; Patrick in the Morning,â€ we check in with Scorch, discuss asshole licking, three escapees from Alcatraz, Billy the Kid, Fargo, retarded brothers, and the NYPDâ€™s super-secret x-ray van. Anthony ends the day yapping about fat fucks, a DUI in an electric wheelchair, George Costanza, and last nightâ€™s Twitter battle because of the democratic debate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncludes an MP4 video file and an MP3 audio file; download both or only what you need and please seed!\r\n\r\nNew ups at: http://thepiratebay.se/user/mothergoose58/\r\n\r\nSubscribe at AnthonyCumia.com!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a244c48bd692420e084e24f0f41e17ce778b614d","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2015-10-14+Dennis+Hof+MP4+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a244c48bd692420e084e24f0f41e17ce778b614d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,68,196,139,214,146,66,14,8,78,36,240,244,30,23,206,119,139,97,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
