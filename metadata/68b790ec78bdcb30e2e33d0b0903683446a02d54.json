Many specialized texts exist - written at a high level - that cover this subject. However, students and even professionals often experience difficulties in setting up and solving even the simplest of models. This can be attributed to three difficulties: the proper choice of model, the absence of precise solutions, and the necessity to make suitable simplifying assumptions and approximations. Overcoming these difficulties is the focus of The Art of Modeling in Science and Engineering.\r\nThe text is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students and practicing professionals in the sciences and engineering with an interest in Modeling based on Mass, Energy and Momentum or Force Balances. The book covers a wide range of physical processes and phenomena drawn from chemical, mechanical, civil, environmental sciences and bio- sciences. A separate section is devoted to &quot;real World&quot; industrial problems. The author explains how to choose the simplest model, obtain an appropriate solution to the problem and make simplifying assumptions/approximations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68b790ec78bdcb30e2e33d0b0903683446a02d54","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Modeling+in+Science+and+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68b790ec78bdcb30e2e33d0b0903683446a02d54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,183,144,236,120,189,203,48,226,227,61,11,9,3,104,52,70,160,45,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
