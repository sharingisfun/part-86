Specifically, the changes in this version are so far-reaching Ã¢â‚¬â€ including a rewrite of most of the macro set and the documentation Ã¢â‚¬â€ that it is necessary to delete the Arachnophilia user directory to realize the full benefit of the changes.\n\nTo make this change, please read these instructions and then:\n\nExit Arachnophilia\nDelete the directory (user home directory)/.Arachnophilia\nRe-run Arachnophilia\nAfter taking these steps, the user will see a reinstallation of the Arachnophilia user files Ã¢â‚¬â€ thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sign that the deletion was carried out successfully. By the way, this is the correct approach to dealing with problems that seem insurmountable Ã¢â‚¬â€ to overcome various problems that might come up, simply delete (user home directory)/.Arachnophilia and run Arachnophilia again.\n\nArachnophilia has become an XHTML workshop.\n\nA new version of HTML has appeared, named Ã¢â‚¬Å“XHTML,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ that has so many advantages over HTML that Arachnophilia has been completely reworked to take advantage of it. Elsewhere in these directions, and in ArachnophiliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s menus and prompts, the term HTML appears, but remember that this is simply a syntactical convenience Ã¢â‚¬â€ it refers to XHTML.\n\nEarlier Arachnophilia difficulties with beautifying and formatting HTML, and analyzing Web pages for tag errors, have been corrected in this version. In past Arachnophilia versions, certain features had to be dropped because they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t coexist with the internal ambiguities and inconsistencies of straight HTML. In the new Arachnophilia version, the best of those features has been restored. Specifically, HTML Beautify now works reliably and HTML Validate Ã¢â‚¬â€ a tool for finding and correcting structural errors, a feature not seen since Arachnophilia 4.0 Ã¢â‚¬â€ is back and works very well.\n\nXHTML is internally consistent in a way that HTML cannot be, and it greatly simplifies the task of Web page design and maintenance. Arachnophilia is now structured around XHTML and it can help you convert your pages from HTML to XHTML.\n\nIf your site has HMTL pages and you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to convert them, some of ArachnophiliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s features arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t going to work for you, in particular the features Ã¢â‚¬Å“HTML BeautifyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“HTML ValidateÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will likely misbehave. If you do decide to upgrade to XHTML, I offer these comments:\n\nIn XHTML, there are no tag ambiguituies. A particular tag always appears the same way, there is no latitude about how a tag can be used.\nAll XHTML tags are either paired , or they are single self-closing tags . There is but one exception (the DOCTYPE tag at the top of a page).\nPast versions of Arachnophilia contained some Ã¢â‚¬Å“relaxedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (read: wrong) tag definitions and practices, in particular the absence of closing\nand tags. These errors have been corrected.\n\n\nimage\n\n\n* Just Run to use...\n\n*Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f199ef72fb1f4bfc472dbe03ba0caac17758b1c3","amp;dn":"Arachnophilia+5.5.2902","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f199ef72fb1f4bfc472dbe03ba0caac17758b1c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,153,239,114,251,31,75,252,71,45,190,3,186,12,170,193,119,88,177,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
