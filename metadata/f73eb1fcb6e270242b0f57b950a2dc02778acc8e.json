Thorp and A.P. Covich) will welcome the comprehensive revision and expansion of that trusted professional reference manual and educational textbook from a single North American tome into a developing multi-volume series covering inland water invertebrates of the world. The series entitled Thorp and CovichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Freshwater Invertebrates (edited by J.H. Thorp) begins with the current Volume I: Ecology and General Biology (edited by J.H. Thorp and D.C. Rogers), which is designed as a companion volume for the remaining books in the series. Those following volumes provide taxonomic coverage for specific zoogeographic regions of the world, starting with Keys to Nearctic Fauna (Vol. II) and Keys to Palaearctic Fauna (Vol. III). Volume I maintains the ecological and general biological focus of the previous editions but now expands coverage globally in all chapters, includes more taxonomic groups (e.g., chapters on individual insect orders), and covers additional functional topics such as invasive species, economic impacts, and functional ecology. As in previous editions, the 4th edition of Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates is designed for use by professionals in universities, government agencies, and private companies as well as by undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nGlobal coverage of aquatic invertebrate ecology\nDiscussions on invertebrate ecology, phylogeny, and general biology written by international experts for each group\nSeparate chapters on invasive species and economic impacts and uses of invertebrates\nEight additional chapters on insect orders and a chapter on freshwater millipedes\nFour new chapters on collecting and culturing techniques, ecology of invasive species, economic impacts, and ecological function of invertebrates\nOverall expansion of ecology and general biology and a shift of the even more detailed taxonomic keys to other volumes in the projected 9-volume series\nIdentification keys to lower taxonomic levels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f73eb1fcb6e270242b0f57b950a2dc02778acc8e","amp;dn":"Thorp+and+Covich%27s+Freshwater+Invertebrates+-+4th+Ed+2015+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f73eb1fcb6e270242b0f57b950a2dc02778acc8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,62,177,252,182,226,112,36,43,15,87,185,80,162,220,2,119,138,204,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
