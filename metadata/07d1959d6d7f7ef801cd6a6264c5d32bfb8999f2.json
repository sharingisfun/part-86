It lets you archive and search mail, Web pages, PDF files, word processing documents, images, and more. Use it to collect information from a variety of sources. Browse different types of files using a standard three-pane interface. Organize them into folders and annotate them with tags and notes, or leave everything in one folder and pin-point the information you need using the live search. Since EagleFiler stores its library in Finder format, you can use it in concert with the other tools in your Mac ecosystem.\n\nEagleFiler in a nutshell:\n\nWith a single keypress, import Web pages, mail messages, or any file on your Mac.\nEagleFiler stores them in an open format: regular files and folders that are fully accessible to your other applications.\nOptionally: encrypt the files, add tags, notes, color-coded labels, and other metadata.\nBrowse by folder or by tag, or use the live search to find the information you need (faster than Spotlight).\nView, edit, or create documents directly in EagleFiler's streamlined interface, or double-click to edit using another application.\n\nWhat's new in this version:\nFixed a regression that sometimes caused errors when opening a library window when running on Mac OS X 10.4 or 10.5.\n\nOperating System Requirements:\n\nThis product is designed to run on the following operating systems:\nMac OS X 10.4 or above\n\n--&gt;&gt; PLEASE SEED &lt;&lt;--","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07d1959d6d7f7ef801cd6a6264c5d32bfb8999f2","amp;dn":"EagleFiler+1.4.14+with+sn+and+manual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07d1959d6d7f7ef801cd6a6264c5d32bfb8999f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,209,149,157,109,127,126,248,1,205,106,98,100,197,211,43,251,137,153,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
