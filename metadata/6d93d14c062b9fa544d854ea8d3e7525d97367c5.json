THE SALSOUL ORCHESTRA was the brainchild of once MFSB member and legendary vibraphonist, Vincent Montana Jr. Formed in 1974, THE SALSOUL ORCHESTRA, house band for the remarkable Salsoul Records, sometimes featured up to 50 members amongst its ranks including a number of former musicians from MFSB. THE SALSOUL ORCHESTRA began an eight-year recording period in 1975 releasing eleven sensational albums during that time featuring production input from, Stan Lucas, Patrick Adams, Bunny Sigler and Tom Moulton through the years.\n\nReleased in 1978 and recorded at the famous Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, UP THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD was produced by the aforementioned Vincent Montana, Jr., and was mixed by the legendary Tom Moulton.\n\nAs the title suggests, UP THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD is inspired by the classic Broadway and film musicals with opening track Ã¢â‚¬ËœEase On Down The RoadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ taken from the Charlie Smalls penned &quot;The Wiz,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a reinterpretation of The Wizard Of Oz, whose Broadway production won 7 Tony Awards. There are also two extended medleys of the famous songs from both West Side Story and Fiddler On The Roof as well as a cover of Ã¢â‚¬ËœEvergreen,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ the theme from A Star Is Born, which closes the album. Sandwiched in between is a great cover of the Beatles &quot;Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club BandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. With Montana producing and arranging and Moulton mixing every track delivers the classic Salsoul sound and feel.\n\nThis newly remastered edition of UP THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD comes complete with extensive liner notes and bonus content making this BBR Remaster a must have for all Funk, Soul, Disco, Philly Soul and Broadway Musical fans out there!\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
