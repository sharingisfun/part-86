It was the band's first album with drummer Ryan Vandeberghe, replacing Derek Grant who had left the group the previous year. The album's musical direction shifted away from the ska punk and hardcore styles of their previous albums and exhibited heavy pop influence, leading many to classify the album as pop punk. A music video was filmed for the single &quot;Sometimes I Don't Mind,&quot; which reached #27 on Billboard's Modern Rock charts.[1] The album itself ranked at #188 on the Billboard 200.\n\nThe album's closing track, &quot;I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,&quot; was originally recorded for the soundtrack to the 1998 movie SLC Punk and was included on the film's soundtrack album.\n\n*Track 14 written &amp; originally performed by Joe South\n\n**********Bit Rate: 256kbps**********\n\n1. &quot;Sometimes I Don't Mind&quot;             3:14\n2. &quot;Permanent Holiday&quot;                  2:07\n3. &quot;The Fade Away&quot;                      3:09\n4. &quot;Too Many Words&quot;                     2:17\n5. &quot;No Sale&quot;                            2:24\n6. &quot;Green&quot;                              2:08\n7. &quot;Extraordinary&quot;                      2:45\n8. &quot;I Hate Everything&quot;                  2:37\n9. &quot;All Out&quot;                            1:53\n10.&quot;Perfect Day&quot;                        2:09\n11.&quot;Sincerity&quot;                          2:39\n12.&quot;Reasons&quot;                            1:12\n13.&quot;Goodbye for Now&quot;                    2:27\n14.&quot;I Never Promised You a Rose Garden&quot; 2:42\n\n**********PLEASE SEED**********","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c40b1cb13659284153c877b135cf2b0ffe0e318f","amp;dn":"The+Suicide+Machines+-+The+Suicide+Machines+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c40b1cb13659284153c877b135cf2b0ffe0e318f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,11,28,177,54,89,40,65,83,200,119,177,53,207,43,15,254,14,49,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
