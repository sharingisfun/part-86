Upon their release, they traveled to LawrenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hometown of Milton, Florida, where they murdered Justin Livingston, LawrenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mentally challenged cousin. Their deadly spree continued when they viciously raped and shot 18-year-old Jennifer Robinson and then cannibalized her body.\n \nAuthor Fred Rosen reports on how Detective Todd Hand solved the case and brought justice to the victimsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ families. Hand had his work cut out for him as there was no clear motive behind these heinous crimes, but during questioning he caught the 2 killers in a lie about Justin LivingstonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whereabouts, which led to their arrests.
