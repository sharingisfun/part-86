Garbage files that can be removed by WashAndGo include temporary files not removed when programmes are closed, old file safety copies which are created automatically by some programmes, 0 byte files with no real content, wrong and confusing Windows Registry entries, duplicate DLL libraries, superfluous and outdated service pack files, wrong Uninstall entries and Internet Explorer, Opera and Firefox browser caches. Together, these unnecessary files can cause a computer to run slower than usual, and take up disk space.\n\nWashAndGo tells its users how much disk space has been freed, so the benefits of running the programme can be seen immediately. A single mouse click starts WashAndGo examining the hard disk. Users then review a list of detected garbage files and authorise WashAndGo to remove them. Users who prefer to be on the safe side can switch on the security option of WashAndGo to enable the recovery, if required, of all removed files for up to 14 days after the clean up.\nThe program is fast, secure, and reliable. - Let WashAndGo reclaim your wasted disk space! \nRequirements:\tNo special requirements \nRelease Date:\tJanuary 15, 2010 \nPlatforms:\tWindows XP, Windows NT 4.x, Windows Me, Windows 98, Windows 95, Windows 2003, Windows 2000, Windows Vista Ultimate x64, Windows Vista Ultimate, Windows Vista Starter, Windows Vista Home Premium x64, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Home Basic x64, Windows Vista Home Basic, Windows Vista Enterprise x64, Windows Vista Enterprise, Windows Vista Business x64, Windows Vista Business , Windows Tablet PC Edition 2005,Windows Media Center Edition 2005","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3c1aaa2669017551ef0a38959e36cba7e134d95","amp;dn":"WashAndGo+2009+Build+11.4.0+Retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3c1aaa2669017551ef0a38959e36cba7e134d95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,193,170,162,102,144,23,85,30,240,163,137,89,227,108,186,126,19,77,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
