Marty Haines\n\n\nIn the underground world of illegal street fighting, Bobby Delgado is the undefeated champion, until he accidentally kills his opponent and is sent to prison. Infuriated by the financial loss and death of his prize fighter, promoter Jarvis Sweet swears vengeance on Delgado and finds a new hitter in the form of Wade Bull, a vicious cold criminal with fighting skills few men can match. With Delgado released from prison, Sweet concocts a ruthless and backstabbing campaign aimed at forcing the reluctant fighter back into the pit. What follows is a brutal and bloody confrontation for survival.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44010ae4d44ff1e1952081f3b5b1d39bd9ca07a5","amp;dn":"Among.Dead.Men.2008.DVDRip.XviD-FiCO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44010ae4d44ff1e1952081f3b5b1d39bd9ca07a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,1,10,228,212,79,241,225,149,32,129,243,181,177,211,155,217,202,7,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
