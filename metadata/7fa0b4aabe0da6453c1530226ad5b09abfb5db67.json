Less well-known are Linda Thompson's &quot;No Telling,&quot; Woody Guthrie's &quot;East Texas Red,&quot; and Dylan's overwrought early song &quot;Seven Curses.&quot; \r\n\r\nRussell's own compositions fit in well with the Western imagery of these story-songs. \r\nIn the leadoff track, &quot;Tonight We Ride,&quot; he quickly name-drops Pancho Villa, and his lyrics about dogs and horses, while providing a bit of comic relief, are much in keeping with the rest. \r\n\r\nRussell sings in a rough voice that occasionally breaks into falsetto yelp, as his and Andrew Hardin's interweaving guitars make up the main part of the drumless arrangements. This is a rough-hewn, low-key effort.\r\n\r\nWilliam Ruhlmann\r\n\r\nIncludes a storming version of Lily, Rosemary &amp; The Jack of Hearts with Eliza Gilkyson &amp; Joe Ely.\r\n\r\n\r\nSonglist:\r\n\r\n01.
