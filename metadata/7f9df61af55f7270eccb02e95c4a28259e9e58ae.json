Rather than an unwieldy dump of thousands of issues that are meticulously numbered and ordered (and whose filenames screw with modern comic reader parsers), the Chronology is presented as a series of ad-hoc collections with a simple volume ordering. I'll be releasing these in series of 10 volumes a piece.\r\n\r\nAs with previous releases of this chronology, strict chronology order has been followed as close as possible, though some flexibility and &quot;grain of salt&quot; needs to be used for proper interpretation. Books have been culled from a variety of sources and all credit goes to the original scanners/rippers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f9df61af55f7270eccb02e95c4a28259e9e58ae","amp;dn":"Superman+Post-Crisis+Chronology%2C+Volumes+291-300","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f9df61af55f7270eccb02e95c4a28259e9e58ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,157,246,26,245,95,114,112,236,203,2,233,92,74,40,37,158,158,88,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
