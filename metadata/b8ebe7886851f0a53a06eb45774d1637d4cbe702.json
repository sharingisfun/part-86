The authors have used software developed within EMULATE (European and North Atlantic daily to MULtidecadal climATE variability) to obtain the extremes indices and temporal trends. The trend atlas provides an easy way to identify spatial patterns for a given time period, region, season, and index. The Atlas clearly shows that climate in Europe has changed over the last 100 to 150 years, such that the occurrence and intensity of warm temperature extremes have increased. Precipitation extremes have also changed, but with a less clear pattern compared to the temperature extremes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8ebe7886851f0a53a06eb45774d1637d4cbe702","amp;dn":"European+Trend+Atlas+of+Extreme+Temperature+%282015%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8ebe7886851f0a53a06eb45774d1637d4cbe702","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,235,231,136,104,81,240,165,58,6,235,69,119,77,22,55,212,203,231,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
