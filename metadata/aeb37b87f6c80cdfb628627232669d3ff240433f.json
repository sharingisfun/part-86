The book was envisaged to bridge the gap in the knowledge of day-to-day applications of Electrical Engineering apart from covering fundamental topics of electrical engineering. This book is organized it two parts, Part - A Covering Electrical Circuits and Measurements including circuit laws, Network theorems, Single phase and Three phase AC circuits, and Electrical measurements. Part - B covers Electrical machines, including DC generators and motors, Transformers, Three phase and Single phase induction motors and Three phase alternators","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeb37b87f6c80cdfb628627232669d3ff240433f","amp;dn":"Basic+Electrical+Engineering+by+K+Uma+Rao","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeb37b87f6c80cdfb628627232669d3ff240433f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,179,123,135,246,200,12,223,182,40,98,114,50,102,157,63,242,64,67,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
