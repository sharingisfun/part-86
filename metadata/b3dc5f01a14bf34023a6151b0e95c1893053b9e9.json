But what separates Eyeball from Byrne's previous offering, the only-fitfully successful Feelings, is a renewed emphasis on lush, natural sounds and consistent production. Nearly every track boasts strings and/or horns, and the textures go a long way in unifying Byrne's insistent genre-hopping. Tracks such as &quot;Smile,&quot; &quot;The Revolution,&quot; &quot;The Accident,&quot; and &quot;Everyone's in Love With You&quot; best demonstrate his new approach: Spare melodies are layered atop subtle, percolating rhythms and then filled in with evocative string arrangements. Better yet, Byrne's two collaborations with legendary Philly soul producer Thom Bell -- the buoyant &quot;Like Humans Do&quot; and &quot;Neighborhood&quot; -- blend in effortlessly with the other material. Of course, old habits die hard: &quot;U.B. Jesus&quot; and &quot;The Great Intoxication&quot; are at once too slick and too simple, with muddled messages both musically and lyrically. (It doesn't help that the latter track features a cringe-inducing, self-referential &quot;Who disco? Who techno? Who hip-hop? Who bebop?...&quot; shout-out.) The remainder of the album vacillates between pleasant Talking Heads-ish pop (&quot;Walk on Water&quot;) and accomplished if out-of-place forays into the Latin avant-garde (&quot;Desconocido Soy&quot;). It's hard to fault Byrne -- who produces an album every three or four years -- for packing as much as he can into one release. So it's best to view Look Into the Eyeball for what it is: an entertaining assimilation of the sundry artists and sounds he's gotten into since his last trip into the studio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3dc5f01a14bf34023a6151b0e95c1893053b9e9","amp;dn":"David+Byrne+-+Look+Into+The+Eyeball+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3dc5f01a14bf34023a6151b0e95c1893053b9e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,220,95,1,161,75,243,64,35,166,21,27,14,149,193,137,48,83,185,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
