The system cleanup utility is well-known among novices and professional PC users alike, thanks to the powerful features and speedy tasks dedicated to removing unnecessary data from the system to restore some of it's stability and free up valuable space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManagement server and console options\r\n\r\nThe network edition of CCleaner is geared toward administrators looking to deploy the program on multiple computers via LAN. It is possible to install both management server and console components, or just one of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClear-Cut interface\r\n\r\nThe interface has a lighter aspect compared to regular CCleaner. At startup, the tool pops up a wizard to help users set up network settings (standard or active directory) when it comes to account credentials for remote installation or MSI installer for local sertup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView network properties\r\n\r\nThe first screen shows network statistics concerning the total number of groups, hosts, offline hosts (with the CCleaner agent installed and not installed), alomng with total agent licenses available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExecute network operations\r\n\r\nCCleaner is able to scan for hosts, disconnect from the network, edit network properties (connection name, host name, port, password), as well as create as many groups for classifying hosts as needed. Creating an agent installer (local MSI) along with it's installation on all online computers that don't have it take a little time and minimal effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem and registry cleaning\r\n\r\nThe well-known CCleaner components can be deployed on the linked workstations: cleaner for Windows and application items, registry cleaner, startup manager and programs uninstaller. Administrators may examine endpoint, management and technican reports, in order to find out various details pertaining to cleaning and defrag scores, oldest audit, most full disks, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe program can create a portable management console. It records the configuration summary, management console and services logs, along with diagnostics reports to file. Moreover, users can specify proxies, password-protect the management console, and switch to another UI language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nCPU and RAM consumption was minimal in my tests. I'm have not come across any stability issues, since the app did not hang, crash or pop up error dialogs. All in all, those looking to extend CCleaner's use by running it remotely on workstations via LAN may look no further than CCleaner Network Edition.\r\n\r\nAnd as always, use of the program is on your own risk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c684f129b2530057b8f94b0f3bf2aebaf3ed882","amp;dn":"CCleaner+Network+Edition+Professional+2.7.0.4176+%2B+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c684f129b2530057b8f94b0f3bf2aebaf3ed882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,104,79,18,155,37,48,5,123,143,148,176,243,191,42,235,175,62,216,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
