It was the band's first studio album in five years, since The Razors Edge (1990). The album featured the return of former drummer Phil Rudd, who had been fired from the band in 1983 as a result of problems with rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young. The three singles released from this album were &quot;Hard as a Rock,&quot; &quot;Cover You in Oil,&quot; and &quot;Hail Caesar.&quot; The album was produced by the prolific and respected producer Rick Rubin. Rubin had briefly worked with the band in 1993 to produce the song/single &quot;Big Gun,&quot; for the soundtrack to the movie Last Action Hero. Two weeks into the U.S. tour, four gigs were cancelled so that Brian Johnson could attend his father's funeral. During the tour, MTV cartoon characters Beavis and Butthead appeared in the intro during concerts. Five of the album's songs were played live, 'Hard As a Rock', 'Boogie Man', 'Cover You In Oil', 'Hail Caesar', and 'Ballbreaker'.\n\nThe album was re-released in 2005 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.\n\nThe album is currently certified Double Platinum by the RIAA in the US, for sales in excess of 2,000,000.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8602980e599009bc11c1679225ff845e644edaa","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+Ballbreaker+%281995%29+%5BLOSSLESS+FLAC%5D%5BTntvillage.Scambioetic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8602980e599009bc11c1679225ff845e644edaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,96,41,128,229,153,0,155,193,28,22,121,34,95,248,69,230,68,237,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
