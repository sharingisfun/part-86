This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nWARNING: \nIf you limit your upload speed during the download FOR WHATEVER REASON, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be kicked-out for good. I am sick and tired not only of Hit&amp;Run, but of 90% who think IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m some kind of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfree launchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ downloading service.
