This new sound of 47SOUL has rapidly amassed fans in the Middle East and Europe by blasting the electric Arabic debka sound through underground music scenes.\n\nOvercoming physical and logistical challenges, they came together to play electronic Palestinian street music. 47SOUL writes and performs to speak about freedom of movement, whether thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sparking new dance styles or singing about breaking down border check points. For the past 2 years the band has based itself between Jordan and the UK, to spread their new wave of Arabic music.\n\nTheir sound is rooted in Arabic Dabke, the celebration dance music from the Bilad Al-Sham area; the name for the land that spans Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, and Jordan. 47SOUL hypes it up with analog synthesizers, drum machines, epic guitar lines, and tripped-out English and Arabic verses from the four singers. The electronic and urban influence in their music takes them far out of the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœworld musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ context and places them in the genre of a new generation of international electronic/hip hop acts that are reinventing the old for the future. This new sound of 47SOUL is called ShamStep.\n\n\n&gt; Current band members:\n\nZ the People (vocals &amp; synths)\nEl Far3i (Derbakeh, Mc/Vocals)\nWalaa Sbeit (percussion, Mc/vocals)\nEl Jehaz (guitar &amp; vocals)\n\n&gt; Website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.47soul.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.47soul.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&gt; If you like the music support the band through: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.indiepush.com/album/shamstep&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.indiepush.com/album/shamstep&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&gt; Uploaded by Peter Aziz @admiralvega","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc170acbd8f12ddeee09f1b3e853afcf8be12437","amp;dn":"47Soul+-+Shamstep+%5BFull+album+-+128kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc170acbd8f12ddeee09f1b3e853afcf8be12437","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,23,10,203,216,241,45,222,238,9,241,179,232,83,175,207,139,225,36,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
