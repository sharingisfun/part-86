Boser (Kluwer, 2004).pdf\r\n\r\nDigitally Assisted Pipeline ADCs: Theory and Implementation explores the opportunity to reduce ADC power dissipation by leveraging digital signal processing capabilities in fine line integrated circuit technology. The described digitally assisted pipelined ADC uses a statistics-based system identification technique as an enabling element to replace precision residue amplifiers with simple open-loop gain stages. The digital compensation of analog circuit distortion eliminates one key factor in the classical noise-speed-linearity constraint loop and thereby enables a significant power reduction. \r\nDigitally Assisted Pipeline ADCs: Theory and Implementation describes in detail the implementation and measurement results of a 12-bit, 75-MSample/sec proof-of-concept prototype. The Experimental converter achieves power savings greater than 60% over conventional implementations. \r\nDigitally Assisted Pipeline ADCs: Theory and Implementation will be of interest to researchers and professionals interested in advances of state-of-the-art in A/D conversion techniques","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9998883ff6c5370b877991678d1e5d3323f49eee","amp;dn":"Digitally+Assisted+Pipeline+ADCs+-+Theory+and+Implementation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9998883ff6c5370b877991678d1e5d3323f49eee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,152,136,63,246,197,55,11,135,121,145,103,141,30,93,51,35,244,158,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
