I want you to look them in the eyes. Make your face the last thing they see.&quot; Veronica (Breslin) has been raised by William (Bentley) to become a weapon. She is put through strenuous exercises and has finally become a killing machine. When a group of teens who take women out to a forest and kill them Veronica decides to put an end to it. This is a difficult movie to review. I have to say that I did like it and this was along the lines of a movie like Hanna. Seeing Breslin in a role like this was very interesting and she pulled it off very well. The only downside to this movie is that it seemed to start in the middle. There is no back story as to why William is doing this and most importantly, why they chose the group they did. On the other hand though the idea behind why Veronica chose them is enough for you to root for her. Overall, a fun movie that bets on the fact that watching Breslin killing will make up for the lack of story. I give this a B","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c17aa6f5f326ff90cbeaba04d7c298639deaea47","amp;dn":"Final+Girl+%282015%29++BrRip+x264.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c17aa6f5f326ff90cbeaba04d7c298639deaea47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,122,166,245,243,38,255,144,203,234,186,4,215,194,152,99,157,234,234,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
