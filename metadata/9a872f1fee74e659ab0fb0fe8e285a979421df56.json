In each place, they face challenges for which they need to combine their own talents with local techniques to outwit the environment they find themselves in. The series explores the incredible world of fishing, looking at its variety of fish and their behaviour in distinct environments, and \r\nrevealing surprising animals and stunning landscapes.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIceland\r\nEarth's Wildest Waters: The Big FishEpisode 1 of 6\r\n\r\nEight anglers embark on their first expedition to the wilderness of Iceland, where they brave extreme cold, wind and rain to fish in some of the most challenging conditions they have ever faced. In the north west, close to the Arctic Circle, the anglers fish from sea kayaks in the freezing fjord before learning to harvest cod using a traditional Icelandic technique. Further south, in a lake heated by volcanic vents, they fly-fish for some of the largest brown trout in the world. Matt Hayes is joined by local fishing expert Vala - she will help him judge which angler must leave the expedition whilst the rest journey on to the next location in their global expedition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a872f1fee74e659ab0fb0fe8e285a979421df56","amp;dn":"Earths.Wildest.Waters-The.Big.Fish-E01-Iceland--720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a872f1fee74e659ab0fb0fe8e285a979421df56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,135,47,31,238,116,230,89,171,15,176,254,142,40,90,151,148,33,223,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
