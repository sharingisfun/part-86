If you're assuming that Asia's 1999 release, ANTHOLOGY, is a best-of collection that features the original versions of the band's biggest hits, you're mistaken. Due to a court order obtained by original Asia singer/bassist John Wetton, the vocals for the songs he originally sang on had to be re-recorded (the vocal and bass duties on ANTHOLOGY are handled by John Payne). This isn't to say that these re-recorded versions of such Asia prog-pop favorites as &quot;Heat of the Moment,&quot; &quot;The Heat Goes On,&quot; &quot;Don't Cry,&quot; and &quot;Go&quot; won't be enjoyable for longtime fans. &quot;Anthology&quot; is a an excellent selection from the albums &quot;Aqua&quot;, &quot;Aria&quot; and &quot;Arena&quot; plus re-recordings of classic hits like &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot; and &quot;Heat Of The Moment&quot;. \n\n\n\nTrack List\n\n\n\n\n01.
