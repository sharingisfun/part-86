But do we really have more to do than the women who came before us? Maybe not.\n\nIn Taming the To-Do List, Glynnis Whitwer exposes a seismic shift in society: from one in which most of us were proactive to one in which we carry the burden of having to respond--to every email, text, tweet, and message we receive. This creates a cycle where everyone else sets the priorities for our days rather than us directing our own lives. The result? We procrastinate, putting off the important stuff for later while we tend to the &quot;urgent&quot; stuff right now","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7108ef09c73f3bb43e0bec67c94bbd448128171c","amp;dn":"Taming+the+To-Do+List%3A+How+to+Choose+Your+Best+Work+Every+Day","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7108ef09c73f3bb43e0bec67c94bbd448128171c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,8,239,9,199,63,59,180,62,11,236,103,201,75,189,68,129,40,23,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
