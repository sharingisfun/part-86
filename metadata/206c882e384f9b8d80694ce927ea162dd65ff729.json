Global demonstrations have shown that technology and design issues are largely solved. However, the mainstreaming of low carbon urban development, particularly at the precinct scale, currently lacks sufficient: standards for measuring carbon covering operational, embodied and transport emissions; assessment and decision-making tools to assist in design options; certifying processes for carbon neutrality within the built environment; and accreditation processes for enabling carbon credits to be generated from precinct-wide urban development.\r\n\r\nNumerous barriers are currently hindering greater adoption of high performance, low carbon developments, many of which relate to implementation and governance. How to enable and manage precinct-scale renewables and other low carbon technologies within an urban setting is a particular challenge","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:206c882e384f9b8d80694ce927ea162dd65ff729","amp;dn":"Decarbonising+Cities+-+Mainstreaming+Low+Carbon+Urban+Developmen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"206c882e384f9b8d80694ce927ea162dd65ff729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,108,136,46,56,79,155,141,128,105,76,233,39,234,22,45,214,95,247,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
