However, one certain definition of the term &quot;revolutionary&quot; is to indicate one who is participating in a revolution, and that certainly befits what this young organist is doing. Carpenter is among the first organ virtuosi to specialize on the virtual pipe organ. Carpenter's imagination runs in equal measure to his courage and willingness to court controversy, and as an audiophile experience, Revolution is extraordinary. This Telarc disc will become an indispensable part of the conversation about the pipe organ, and its future, for a long time to come, and from the sheer thrill ride aspect of it, is undeniably invigorating.\r\n\r\nFrom http://www.allmusic.com/album/revolutionary-includes-bonus-dvd-mw0001866697\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n1.
