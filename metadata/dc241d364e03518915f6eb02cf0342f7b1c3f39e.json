The cover artwork for the CD was created by tattoo artist German Latorres and perfectly captures the evil vibe of the album.\r\n\r\nMALEVOLENT CREATION vocalist and founding member Bret Hoffmann previously stated about the band's new record deal: &quot;It feels great to have the guys believe in us and our new songs, and really want to stand behind them and the band, and push us forward to bigger things! I mean, I think we have always been a bit underrated (I hear that from a lot of fans too) and I really think with this signing, we have a great chance to boost this band up!!! It's also a pleasure to have drummer Justin DiPinto back in the fold! He brings the hungry aggressive quality this band has always had back to the forefront!&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Along with guitarist Gio Geraca, bassist/founding member Jason Blachowicz and returning drummer Justin DiPinto, we no longer have the word 'compromise' associated with band and its music. We have had more than enough time to write, re-write and perfect our new material and deliver it the way we want for ourselves and fans.&quot;\r\n\r\n1. \tDead Man's Path \t04:51 \t \r\n2. \tSoul Razer \t04:01 \t \r\n3. \tImperium (Kill Force Rising) \t06:09 \t \r\n4. \tCorporate Weaponry \t03:55 \t \r\n5. \tBlood of the Fallen \t04:52 \t  \r\n6. \tResistance Is Victory \t03:47 \t \r\n7. \t12th Prophecy \t04:14 \t \r\n8. \tExtinction Personified \t04:10 \t \r\n9. \tFragmental Sanity \t04:08 \t \r\n10. \tFace Your Fear \t04:24 \t \r\n  \t44:31 \t \r\n\r\nmp3 320k\r\n\r\n\r\nMALEVOLENT CREATION is:\r\n\r\nPhil Fasciana - guitar\r\nBret Hoffman - vocals\r\nJason Blachowicz - bass guitar\r\nJustin DiPinto - drums\r\nGio Geraca - guitar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc241d364e03518915f6eb02cf0342f7b1c3f39e","amp;dn":"Malevolent+Creation+-+Dead+Man%27s+Path+%282015%29+320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc241d364e03518915f6eb02cf0342f7b1c3f39e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,36,29,54,78,3,81,137,21,246,235,2,207,3,66,247,177,195,243,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
