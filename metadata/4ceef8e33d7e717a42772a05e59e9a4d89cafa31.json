The authors discuss a regulatory and management infrastructure for ensuring long-term, reliable applications of onsite systems for wastewater management. The book and its supporting web-site (www.advancedonsitesystems.com) are an information catalog for advanced onsite wastewater technologies. This combination offers tools that will help onsite wastewater professionals communicate effectively with each other and their clients, thus minimizing the confusion and misunderstandings often related to the use of advanced onsite systems. \r\n\r\nThe authors provide an overview of advanced onsite systems technologies and compare them to conventional onsite systems and centralized wastewater systems. They present key concepts for decentralized wastewater solutions and information on advanced onsite wastewater treatment and effluent dispersal technologies currently available. The book delineates a management, regulatory, and planning framework for adopting the use of advanced onsite systems technologies as alternatives to conventional septic systems and centralized collection and treatment plants. It concludes with an exploration of the future of advanced onsite systems technologies and their uses. \r\n\r\nA toolbox for service professionals, regulators, and community planners, the book highlights objective methods to assess the performance of technologies and examples of real-world applications. The authors detail a solution-driven and performance-based regulatory framework for the use of advanced onsite systems as a true alternative to centralized collection and treatment plants and offer guidance on how to plan for future growth with such systems. They answer the age-old question of &quot;what to do when the land doesn't perc and sewer isn't coming?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ceef8e33d7e717a42772a05e59e9a4d89cafa31","amp;dn":"Advanced+Onsite+Wastewater+Systems+Technologies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ceef8e33d7e717a42772a05e59e9a4d89cafa31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,238,248,227,61,126,113,122,66,119,42,5,229,158,154,77,137,202,250,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
