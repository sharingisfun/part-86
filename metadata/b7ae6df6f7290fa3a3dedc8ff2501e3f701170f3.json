Hayden has chronicled experiences from her long career as a special education teacher in several books, including One Child and The Tiger's Child. Successes in this difficult and often frustrating field can be few and hard won, a fact which Hayden deftly illustrates while simultaneously offering hope and joy in small victories. This time she brings to life the story of a scruffy sevenÃ¢â‚¬â€œyearÃ¢â‚¬â€œold, Venus, who is so unresponsive that Hayden searches for signs of deafness, brain damage or mental retardation. The author is relentless in her attempt to diagnose the cause of Venus's 'almost catatonic' state, which is punctuated by occasional violent outbursts. In this firstÃ¢â‚¬â€œperson narrative, Hayden also shares her own thoughts, worries and reflections on the strained relationship with a mismatched classroom aide, creating a rich tapestry of the dynamics of a group of special needs youngsters and the adults who try to help them.\n\nOne Child:\nHayden recounts her battle to uncover the keen intelligence and touch the emotions of a troubled, sexually molested six-year-old girl who abused a younger child and was placed in her class for retarded pre-adolescents while awaiting space in a state institution. Sheila came into Torey Hayden's class for &quot;special children&quot; at the age of 6 after having tied a 3-year-old child to a tree and critically burned him. One Child is Torey Hayden's story of her attempt to tap the unbelievable capacity of this tortured child. Parts of this book - the savage sexual molestation - will enrage you. Parts of this book - Sheila's quiet description of her anger and fears and doubts - will make you cry. And parts of this book - Sheila's gradual realization of her own potential - may make you cheer. - New York Times Book Review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7ae6df6f7290fa3a3dedc8ff2501e3f701170f3","amp;dn":"Beautiful+Child+%26amp%3B+One+Child++by+Torey+Hayden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7ae6df6f7290fa3a3dedc8ff2501e3f701170f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,174,109,246,247,41,15,163,163,222,220,143,242,80,30,63,112,17,112,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
