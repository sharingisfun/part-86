Our goal is to make Hardland one of the great action adventure RPGs. We would be thrilled to have you join us on this journey to find out what the land ruled by the dying Elder King is truly like. Hardland is currently in a pre-alpha stage which means there are many unfinished features and content missing from the game. We estimate to be able to release the finished game during 2015.\n\nWe want to make Hardland a world full of interesting characters, creatures, quests, and mysterious places. We will not dictate how you should play this game. We merely set the stage and let you make your own decisions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92bb32e80075e50e785ff4367f407b634eaefb24","amp;dn":"Hardland+-+Release+15","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92bb32e80075e50e785ff4367f407b634eaefb24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,187,50,232,0,117,229,14,120,95,244,54,127,64,123,99,78,174,251,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
