Looking at the UK's long and rich baking heritage, The Year in Cakes &amp; Bakes includes over 100 delicious recipes, from a Hogmanay Whisky Fruit and Nut Cake to a Bonfire Night Toffee Apple Pie, and from Lemon Easter Sugar Biscuits to a Spiced Figgy Sponge Pudding. With recipes from the contestants, traditional favorites, and new creations reflecting the way we bake today, as well as Mary and Paul's Showstoppers, Signature Bakes, and Technical Challenges, the book is for anyone who likes to celebrate a special occasion by serving something homemade with love","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeed3a0854b625fb896e8c971ef1cfd3b8e4776c","amp;dn":"Great+British+Bake+Off%3A+Celebrations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeed3a0854b625fb896e8c971ef1cfd3b8e4776c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,237,58,8,84,182,37,251,137,110,140,151,30,241,207,211,184,228,119,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
