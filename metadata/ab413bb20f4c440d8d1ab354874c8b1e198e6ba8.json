L. Mencken, and middle-class readers applauded his attack on their old middleclass myths. The war had destroyed the official culture which waged and supported itÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;smashed it like an aged and brittle shell,&quot; as Robert Sklar says in his introduction to the present bookÃ¢â‚¬â€and freed the creative life so long contained within.\n\n&quot;It was an astonishing moment, a moment when a cultural order that had dominated American life since the eighteenth century lost its hold on the minds of its adherentsÃ¢â‚¬â€lost its force at the very time it was reaching out to legalize previously informal control over culture.
