The world has become a lawless civilization where people must kill or be killed. The barren roads belong to gangs of cutthroats who rob and kill for water, a pair of shoes, a lighter, or just for fun. Eli is a peaceful man who only acts in self defense, and becomes a warrior with unbelievable killing skills when he is challenged. After the war and the &quot;Big Flash&quot;, Eli was guided by a higher power to a hidden book and given the task of protecting the book and taking it to its final destination. Eli guards the book with his life, because he knows that the book is the only hope that humanity has for its future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:325c1d94ea5ffc415b73d470da622830d348672d","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+Eli++2010+CAM+Xvid+TA+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"325c1d94ea5ffc415b73d470da622830d348672d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,92,29,148,234,95,252,65,91,115,212,112,218,98,40,48,211,72,103,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
