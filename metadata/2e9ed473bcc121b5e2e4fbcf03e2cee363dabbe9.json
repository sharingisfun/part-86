During this period Adrian Smith was added to the band on lead and rhythm guitar replacing Dennis Stratton. This release is sourced from the 97 WLPX radio broadcast of their first United States tour. Some sites have this show listed as being played on June 22 instead of the 26th. This is an excellent concert with Paul DiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Anno upfront in the mix. Sadly because of substance abuse he would be fired during this tour and replaced by Bruce Dickinson who performed his first Maiden show on October 26th 1981 at the Palasport in Bolonga, Italy. What we have here is one of his last concerts and from the sounds of the band and audience a very impressive one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e9ed473bcc121b5e2e4fbcf03e2cee363dabbe9","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Milwaukee+81+SOUNDBOARD+COVERS+INCLUDED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e9ed473bcc121b5e2e4fbcf03e2cee363dabbe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,158,212,115,188,193,33,181,226,228,251,207,3,226,206,227,99,218,187,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
