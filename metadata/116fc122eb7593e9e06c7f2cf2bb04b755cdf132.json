As each generation is based on a theme, this team adopted playing cards; Jack, Ace, King and Queen.\r\n\r\nOf particular note is the Queen ranger, an empowered woman who kicked ass. That was pretty rare, if nonexistent, in any 70s show. Another great aspect was the music, which is also collected here.\r\n\r\nThe first three episodes are English subbed by Love &amp; Careand I think all the unsubbed DVD raws come courtesy of BunnyhatJAKQ vs Goranger is from GUIS (http://www.grownupsinspandex.com/).\r\n\r\nJAKQ soundtracks are from Citsrusâ€™ Tokusatsu Super Music Collection.\r\n\r\nPlease seed this hard to get torrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:116fc122eb7593e9e06c7f2cf2bb04b755cdf132","amp;dn":"JAKQ+Blitzkrieg+Squad+-+Super+Sentai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"116fc122eb7593e9e06c7f2cf2bb04b755cdf132","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,111,193,34,235,117,147,233,224,108,127,44,242,187,4,183,85,205,241,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
