At the moment Deep Purple were\r\ndue to appear, Ritchie Blackmore locked himself in his dressing room and refused to go onstage.\r\nPrevious performers had finished early, and it was still not sunset, the time at which the band had originally\r\nbeen scheduled to start. Blackmore felt this would dull the effect of the band's light show. After ABC brought\r\nin a sheriff to arrest him, Blackmore agreed to perform. At the culmination of the performance, he destroyed\r\nseveral of his guitars and threw one of his amplifier stacks off the edge of the stage. He also struck one of\r\nthe ABC cameras with a guitar and, in recorded footage, can be seen arranging for his road crew to set off a\r\npyrotechnic device in one of his amplifiers, creating a large fireball that was quickly extinguished.\r\nThe band quickly exited the venue by helicopter, avoiding fire marshals, police officers and ABC executives.\r\n\r\nLine Up:\r\n\r\nRitchie Blackmore: guitar\r\nDavid Coverdale: lead vocals\r\nGlenn Hughes: bass, vocals\r\nJon Lord: organ, keyboards\r\nIan Paice: drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71058811fcf42e4f5afc4257d90c17a05e048e67","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple-Live+in+California.1974%5B48Hz.24Bit%5DFLAC-eNJ0Y-iT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71058811fcf42e4f5afc4257d90c17a05e048e67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,5,136,17,252,244,46,79,90,252,66,87,217,12,23,160,94,4,142,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
