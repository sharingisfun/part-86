Period.\r\nOn the 'Underworld Shakedown''s thanx list huddle guys and gals like: Philip K. Dick, Ranxerox, Iggy Pop, Link Wray, the Human Expression, the Velvet Underground, Larry &amp; the Bluenotes, Johnny Burnette, Catherine Deneuve and the whole LP was dedicated to James Cagney!\r\nYou know, the dude on &quot;White Heat&quot; movie!\r\nI mean, in a time when the whole wide world gave cool garage revivalists that dedicated their albums to the Flintstones, these fuckers pick on the above!\r\nAh and the music's here a blender of all these. Not only Garage. To tell you the truth, I still believe this is one of the BEST albums rock n roll ever throw out! And yes, it came from a small corner of this earth that has nothing to do with rock n roll! Nothing at all! Greece....\r\n&quot;The Valley of Death&quot; did Greg Shaw check them, &quot;The Night of the Phantom&quot; tears in pieces Larry's original, &quot;Sidewalk Stroll&quot; has the best sneaky riff Link Wray never produced and &quot;Repulsion&quot; has the sweat of Catherine Deneuve's beautiful eyes in Roman Polanski's movie with the same name.\r\n&quot;Misirlou&quot; proves why only Greeks can play her (ask Roubanis too), and &quot;Blue Moon&quot; has the lament of Elvis' loss.\r\nYou really need more...?\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/ooFqNZG.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
