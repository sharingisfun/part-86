It will be released on October 2, 2015.[1] It is the first album since Hate Crew Deathroll to not feature guitarist Roope Latvala due to his departure from the band in May 2015, making this the band's first album as a four-piece group with Alexi Laiho handling all guitar duties.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, the band didn't use a commercial recording studio. Instead they opted to use a converted warehouse to enhance the ambiance of the sound.\r\n\r\nThis is the first album since Something Wild that uses the standard C# tuning but in two songs only: Hold Your Tongue and Suicide Bomber, while the rest of the songs use the drop B tuning.\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\nAll songs written and composed by Alexi Laiho. \r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;I Hurt&quot;   \t4:29\r\n2. \t&quot;My Bodom (I Am the Only One)&quot;   \t4:18\r\n3. \t&quot;Morrigan&quot;   \t5:06\r\n4. \t&quot;Horns&quot;   \t3:24\r\n5. \t&quot;Prayer for the Afflicted&quot;   \t4:55\r\n6. \t&quot;I Worship Chaos&quot;   \t3:39\r\n7. \t&quot;Hold Your Tongue&quot;   \t4:02\r\n8. \t&quot;Suicide Bomber&quot;   \t3:33\r\n9. \t&quot;All for Nothing&quot;   \t5:42\r\n10. \t&quot;Widdershins&quot;   \t5:11\r\nTotal length:\r\n\t45:05 \t\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\nChildren of Bodom\r\n\r\n    Alexi Laiho â€“ lead vocals, guitars\r\n    Jaska Raatikainen â€“ drums, backing vocals\r\n    Henkka SeppÃ¤lÃ¤ â€“ bass guitar, backing vocals\r\n    Janne Wirman â€“ keyboards\r\n\r\nProduction\r\n\r\n    Peter TÃ¤gtgren â€“ producer\r\n    Mikko Karmila â€“ producer, engineering, mixing\r\n    Tuomas Korpi â€“ cover art","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94566c240df4602184fa6cf93ffc96d818b0f9ee","amp;dn":"Children+Of+Bodom+-+I+Worship+Chaos+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94566c240df4602184fa6cf93ffc96d818b0f9ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,86,108,36,13,244,96,33,132,250,108,249,63,252,150,216,24,176,249,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
