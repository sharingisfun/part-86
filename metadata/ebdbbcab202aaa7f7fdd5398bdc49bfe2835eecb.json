Ralph Bates was Michel Lebrun, the Deputy Director, who was concerned about keeping to the rules. Fiona Gaunt played Doctor Helen Smith, the base's psychiatrist, and Barry Lowe played Tom Hill, the head of the base technical section.[1]\r\n\r\nThe programme was notable for its combination of realistic spaceflight procedures, ensured by hiring BBC technical adviser James Burke, and its strong character-based writing.[1] Although very dated in terms of its looks and assumptions about the future, it remains well regarded in retrospect.[4]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebdbbcab202aaa7f7fdd5398bdc49bfe2835eecb","amp;dn":"Moonbase+3+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebdbbcab202aaa7f7fdd5398bdc49bfe2835eecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,219,188,171,32,42,170,127,127,221,83,152,189,196,155,254,40,53,238,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
