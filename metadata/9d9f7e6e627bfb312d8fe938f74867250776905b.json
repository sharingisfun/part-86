There were multiple &quot;Severe Weather Warnings&quot; (Heavy rain, winds and tornado watch was in effect) that stopped bands from playing during their set and several from playing at all. Priority was given to the bands on the two main stages (Jack Daniel's &amp; Monster), therefore if you were a band that played on the two smaller ones (Reverb Nation &amp; JÃ¤germeister) you were not allowed to make up your set if the weather had caused your band to not play during your allotted time. Slayer was originally slated to play at 7:10 PM but came on around 8:00 PM. I didn't manage to get front row but I was about 15 feet back on the inner half. Exodus had been cancelled earlier during the day so it was awesome to get to see Gary Holt playing.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecording 'Proof' Comments:\r\n\r\nOn track 05, &quot;Chemical Warfare&quot; at 6:06-6:15, Tom Araya says, &quot;I'm not even going to ask you how your day's been. I know how its been. The best thing to do is to say thank you for fucking hanging around.&quot; - Referring to the severe weather warnings previously mentioned. He goes on to talk about the weather some more as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Please feel free to convert/chop/edit/share however you like. I only ask that you keep the Taper's notes and other files with it for posterity and context.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrought to you by:\r\n \nhttp://www.MetJITF.com\r\n\r\n- JITF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d9f7e6e627bfb312d8fe938f74867250776905b","amp;dn":"Slayer+-+April+26%2C+2015+-+Jacksonville%2C+Florida","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d9f7e6e627bfb312d8fe938f74867250776905b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,159,126,110,98,123,251,49,45,143,233,56,247,72,103,37,7,118,144,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
