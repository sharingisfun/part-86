The screenplay for the feature is by Pamela Pettler (Monster House); directors Tim Burton (Beetlejuice) and Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted) are among the feature versionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s producers.\n\nThe time is the too-near future. Powered and enabled by the invention known as the Great Machine, the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s machines have turned on mankind and sparked social unrest, decimating the human population before being largely shut down.\n\nBut as our world fell to pieces, a mission began to salvage the legacy of civilization; a group of small creations was given the spark of life by a scientist in the final days of humanity, and they continue to exist post-apocalypse. Another of their own, #9 (voiced by Elijah Wood), emerges and displays leadership qualities that may help them survive and possibly even thrive. The conflicted but resilient tribe already includes #1 (Christopher Plummer), a domineering war veteran and the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s longtime leader; #2 (Martin Landau), a kindly but now-frail inventor; #3 and #4, scholarly twins who communicate nonverbally and mostly with each other; #5 (John C. Reilly), a stalwart and nurturing engineer; #6 (Crispin Glover), an erratic artist beset by visions; #7 (Jennifer Connelly), a brave and self-sufficient warrior; and #8 (Fred Tatasciore), the none-too-bright muscle and enforcer for #1.\n\nWith their group so few, these ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstitchpunkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ creations must summon individual strengths well beyond their own proportions in order to outwit and fight against still-functioning machines, one of which is a marauding mechanized beast. In the darkness just before the dawn, #9 rallies everyone of his number to band together.\n\nWhile showcasing a stunning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsteampunkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½-styled visual brilliance, 9 dynamically explores the will to live, the power of community, and how one soul can change the world.\n\nA Focus Features presentation in association with Relativity Media of a Jim Lemley/Tim Burton/Timur Bekmambetov production. 9.
