But when the \n         three Legendary Pokmon Raikou, Entei, and Suicune suddenly arrive \n         and begin rampaging through the streets, its up to Ash and his \n         companions, along with their new Pokmon friend Zorua, to uncover \n         the secret behind the immense and powerful forces at work. What \n         strange and dangerous powers are afoot in Crown City? Why did Celebi \n         suddenly return after vanishing for twenty years? And why is the \n         mighty Zoroark unleashing its fury upon the town?
