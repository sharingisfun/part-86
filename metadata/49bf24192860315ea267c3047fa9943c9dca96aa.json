Joe Kenda spent 23 years in the Colorado Springs Police Department, where he amassed a lifetime of memories catching killers and helping solve close to 400 homicide investigations. The vivid memories are brought back to life in this hourlong series, as Kenda reopens his &quot;Murder Books&quot; for viewers -- folders in which every detail of his murder cases is held -- to revisit the most disturbing cases still haunting him today. As he details the process of how he solved the crimes, Kendra also embarks on a personal journey, coming to terms with long-suppressed nightmares. As he says, &quot;I don't want to tell these stories. I need to.&quot;\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1934673/\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is season 1 of 4 that I have of these 720p HDTV rips.
