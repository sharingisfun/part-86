With all the ingredients required to make a cult classic, Om Darbadar is the kind of movie that can easily polarize critics and audiences alike. It is, in fact, surprising that the National Film Development Corporation consented to produce this film. Using image, sound and montage to the maximum extent (and often gratuitously) and dialog that seem like knitted from parts of different sentences, almost always making no meaning (written by Kuku, also the lyricist and the art director of the film), Swaroop's film is an antithesis to whatever is recognized globally as Indian cinema ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a reason good enough to make Om Darbadar a must-see movie. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246825/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246825/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1263c7da4c7d226b9eafb203c3d411fce4373695","amp;dn":"Om-Dar-Ba-Dar+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1263c7da4c7d226b9eafb203c3d411fce4373695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,99,199,218,76,125,34,107,158,175,178,3,195,212,17,252,228,55,54,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
