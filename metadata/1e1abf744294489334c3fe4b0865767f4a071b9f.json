The band, initially called Roundabout, was the idea of former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis, who recruited Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore before leaving the project. The Mk. I line-up of the band was completed by vocalist/frontman Rod Evans, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Ian Paice, in March 1968.\r\n\r\nAfter about two months of rehearsals, Shades of Deep Purple was recorded in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more psychedelic. Stylistically the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever growing audience in the late 60s.\r\n\r\nThe album was not well received in the UK, where it sold very little and did not chart. In the US, on the other hand, it was a success and the single &quot;Hush&quot;, an energetic rock track originally written by Joe South, became very popular at the time, reaching number 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.[1] The good sales of the album and the intense radio play of the single contributed largely to the attention Deep Purple would get in their early US tours and also during the 70s. Modern reviews of the album are generally positive and consider Shades of Deep Purple an important piece in the history of Deep Purple.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\nSide one\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;And the Address&quot; (instrumental) \tRitchie Blackmore, Jon Lord \t4:38\r\n2. \t&quot;Hush&quot;   \tJoe South \t4:24\r\n3. \t&quot;One More Rainy Day&quot;   \tLord, Rod Evans \t3:40\r\n4. \t&quot;Prelude: Happiness / I'm So Glad&quot;   \tBlackmore, Evans, Lord, Ian Paice, Nick Simper / Skip James \t7:19\r\n\r\nSide two\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;Mandrake Root&quot;   \tBlackmore, Lord, Evans \t6:09\r\n2. \t&quot;Help!&quot;   \tJohn Lennon, Paul McCartney \t6:01\r\n3. \t&quot;Love Help Me&quot;   \tBlackmore, Evans \t3:49\r\n4. \t&quot;Hey Joe&quot;   \tBilly Roberts \t7:33\r\n\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\nDeep Purple\r\n\r\n    Rod Evans â€“ lead vocals\r\n    Ritchie Blackmore â€“ guitar\r\n    Jon Lord â€“ organ, backing vocals\r\n    Nick Simper â€“ bass, backing vocals\r\n    Ian Paice â€“ drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e1abf744294489334c3fe4b0865767f4a071b9f","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Shades+Of+Deep+Purple+1968+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e1abf744294489334c3fe4b0865767f4a071b9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,26,191,116,66,148,72,147,52,195,254,75,8,101,118,127,74,7,27,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
