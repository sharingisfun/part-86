A cultural icon, he is commonly known simply as Elvis and is also sometimes referred to as The King of Rock 'n' Roll or The King.\nPresley began his career in 1954 as one of the first performers of rockabilly, an uptempo fusion of country and rhythm and blues with a strong back beat. His novel versions of existing songs, mixing &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; sounds, made him popularÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and controversialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as did his uninhibited stage and television performances. Presley had a versatile voice[8] and he had unusually wide success encompassing many genres, including rock and roll, gospel, blues, country, ballads and pop. To date, he has been inducted into four music halls of fame.\nIn 1968, after making movies in Hollywood and having been away from the stage for seven years, he returned to live performances in a television special, which led to a string of successful tours across the U.S., notably in Las Vegas, for the remainder of his career. In 1973, Presley staged the first global live concert via satellite (Aloha from Hawaii), reaching at least one billion viewers live and an additional 500 million on delay. It remains the most watched broadcast by an individual entertainer in television history.\nThroughout his career, he set records for concert attendance, television ratings and recordings sales. He is one of the best-selling solo artists in the history of popular music, with sales between 600 million and one billion worldwide, and he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture. Among his many awards and accolades are 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received at age 36, and being named One of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation for 1970 by the United States Jaycees.\n\nHealth problems, prescription drug dependence, and other factors led to his death at the age of 42.\n\n\nJerry Lee Lewis\n\nJerry Lee Lewis (born September 29, 1935) is an American rock and roll and country music singer, songwriter and pianist. An early pioneer of rock and roll music, Lewis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 and his pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked him #24 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2003, they listed his box set All Killer, No Filler: The Anthology #242 on their list of &quot;500 greatest albums of all time&quot;.\nLewis was born to the poor family of Elmo and Mamie Lewis in Ferriday in Concordia Parish in eastern Louisiana, and began playing piano in his youth with his two cousins, Mickey Gilley and Jimmy Swaggart. His parents mortgaged their farm to buy him a piano. Influenced by a piano-playing older cousin Carl McVoy, the radio, and the sounds from the black juke joint across the tracks, Haney's Big House, Lewis developed his own style mixing rhythm and blues, boogie-woogie, gospel, and country music, as well as ideas from established &quot;country boogie&quot; pianists like recording artists Moon Mullican and Merrill Moore. Soon he was playing professionally. His mother enrolled him in Southwestern Assemblies of God University in Waxahachie, Texas, secure in the knowledge that her son would now be exclusively singing his songs to the Lord. But Lewis daringly played a boogie woogie rendition of &quot;My God Is Real&quot; at a church assembly that sent him packing the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show Jerry played some &quot;worldly&quot; music. The next morning, the dean of the school called both Jerry and Pearry into his office to expel them both. Jerry then said that Pearry shouldn't be expelled because &quot;he didn't know what I was going to do.&quot; Years later Pearry asked Jerry &quot;Are you still playing the devil's music?&quot; Jerry replied &quot;Yes, I am. But you know it's strange, the same music that they kicked me out of school for is the same kind of music they play in their churches today. The difference is, I know I am playing for the devil and they don't.&quot;\nLeaving religious music behind so far as performing, he paid dues at clubs in and around Ferriday and Natchez, Mississippi. He became a part of the burgeoning new rock and roll sound, cutting his first demo recording in 1954. Lewis travelled to Memphis, Tennessee in November 1956, to audition for Sun Records. Label owner Sam Phillips was away on a trip to Florida, but producer and engineer Jack Clement recorded Lewis' rendition of Ray Price's &quot;Crazy Arms&quot; and his own composition &quot;End of The Road&quot;. During December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically, both as a solo artist and as a session musician for other Sun artists, such as Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun during late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins' &quot;Matchbox&quot;, &quot;Your True Love&quot;, &quot;You Can Do No Wrong&quot;, and &quot;Put Your Cat Clothes On&quot;, and Billy Lee Riley's &quot;Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll&quot;. Until this time, rockabilly had rarely featured piano, but it proved a highly influential addition and rockabilly artists on other labels soon also started working with pianists.\nOn December 4, 1956, Elvis Presley dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano. The three started an impromptu jam session, and Phillips left the tape running. He later telephoned Johnny Cash and brought him in to join the others. These recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived, and have been released on CD under the title Million Dollar Quartet. Tracks also include Elvis Presley's &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot; and &quot;Paralyzed&quot;, Chuck Berry's &quot;Brown Eyed Handsome Man&quot;, Pat Boone's &quot;Don't Forbid Me&quot; and Presley doing an impersonation of\nJackie Wilson (who was then with Billy Ward and the Dominoes) impersonating him on &quot;Don't Be Cruel&quot;.\nLewis's own singles (on which he was billed as Jerry Lee Lewis and his Pumping Piano) advanced his career as a soloist during 1957, with hits such as &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On&quot; and &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot;, his biggest hit, bringing him to national and international fame, despite criticism for the songs' overtly sexual undertones which prompted some radio stations to boycott them.\nIn 2005, &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On&quot; was selected for permanent preservation in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress.\nAccording to several first hand sources, including Johnny Cash, Lewis himself, who was devoutly Christian, was also troubled by the sinful nature of his own material, which he firmly believed was leading himself and his audience to hell. This aspect of Lewis' character was depicted in Waylon Payne's portrayal of Lewis in the 2005 film Walk the Line, based on Cash's autobiographies. Lewis would often kick the piano bench out of the way to play standing, rake his hands up and down the keyboard for dramatic accent, sit down on the keyboard and even stand on top of the instrument. His first TV appearance, in which he demonstrated some of these moves, was on The Steve Allen Show on July 28, 1957, where he played the song &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On&quot;. He is also reputed to have set a piano on fire at the end of a live performance, in protest at being billed below Chuck Berry.\nHis dynamic performance style can be seen in films such as High School Confidential (he sang the title song from the back of a flatbed truck), and Jamboree. He has been called &quot;rock &amp; roll's first great wild man&quot; and also &quot;rock &amp; roll's first great eclectic.&quot; Classical composer Michael Nyman has also cited Lewis's style as the progenitor of his own aesthetic.\n\n\nFats Domino\n\nAntoine Dominique &quot;Fats&quot; Domino (born February 26, 1928 in New Orleans, Louisiana) is an R&amp;B and rock and roll pianist and singer-songwriter.\nDomino first attracted national attention with &quot;The Fat Man&quot; in 1949 on Imperial Records. This song is an early rock and roll record, featuring a rolling piano and Domino doing &quot;wah-wah&quot; vocalizing over a fat back beat. It sold over a million copies and is widely regarded as the first rock and roll record to do so.\nFats Domino then released a series of hit songs with producer and co-writer Dave Bartholomew, saxophonists Herbert Hardesty and Alvin &quot;Red&quot; Tyler and drummer Earl Palmer. Other notable and long-standing musicians in Domino's band were saxophonists Reggie Houston, Lee Allen, and Fred Kemp, who was also Domino's trusted bandleader. Domino finally crossed into the pop mainstream with &quot;Ain't That a Shame&quot; (1955), which hit the Top Ten, though Pat Boone characteristically hit #1 with a milder cover of the song that received wider radio airplay in a racially-segregated era. Domino would eventually release 37 Top 40 singles, &quot;Whole Lotta Loving&quot; and &quot;Blue Monday&quot; among them.\nHis 1956 up tempo version of the 1940 Bobby Cerdeira, Al Lewis &amp; Larry Stock song, &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; reached #2 in the Top 40, was #1 on the R&amp;B charts for 11 weeks, and was his biggest hit. &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot; sold more than 5 million copies worldwide in 1956-57. The song had earlier been recorded by Gene Autry, and Louis Armstrong among many others. He also hit singles between 1956-1959, including &quot;When My Dreamboat Comes Home&quot; (Pop #14), &quot;I'm Walkin'&quot; (Pop #4), &quot;Valley of Tears&quot; (Pop #8), &quot;It's You I Love&quot; (Pop #6), &quot;Whole Lotta Loving&quot; (Pop #6), &quot;I Want to Walk You Home&quot; (Pop #8), and &quot;Be My Guest&quot; (Pop #8).\nFats appeared in two films released in 1956: Shake, Rattle &amp; Rock![3] and The Girl Can't Help It. On December 18, 1957, Domino's hit &quot;The Big Beat&quot; was featured on Dick Clark's American Bandstand.\nDomino continued to have a steady series of hits for Imperial through early 1962, including &quot;Walkin' to New Orleans&quot; (1960) (Pop #6) co-written by Bobby Charles and &quot;My Girl, Josephine&quot; (Pop #14) from the same year. After Imperial Records was sold to outside interests in early 1963, Domino left the label: &quot;I stuck with them until they sold out&quot;, he claimed in 1979. In all, Domino recorded over 60 singles for the label, placing 40 songs in the top 10 on the R&amp;B charts, and scoring 11 top 10 singles on the pop charts. Twenty-two of Domino's Imperial singles were double-sided hits.\n\n\nLittle Richard\n\nRichard Wayne Penniman (born December 5, 1932), known by the stage name Little Richard, is an American singer, songwriter, pianist and recording artist, considered key in the transition from rhythm and blues to rock and roll in the 1950s. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame web site entry on Richard states that:\n\n&quot;More than any other performer - save, perhaps, Elvis Presley, Little Richard blew the lid off the Fifties, laying the foundation for rock and roll with his explosive music and charismatic persona. On record, he made spine-tingling rock and roll. His frantically charged piano playing and raspy, shouted vocals on such classics as &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;, &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; and &quot;Good Golly, Miss Molly&quot; defined the dynamic sound of rock and roll.&quot;\n\nBeginning his recording career in 1951 by imitating the Gospel-influenced style of late-40s jump blues artist Billy Wright, Little Richard did not break through commercially until 1955. That year, under the guidance of Robert &quot;Bumps&quot; Blackwell, he began recording in a style he had been performing onstage for years, featuring varied rhythm, a heavy backbeat, funky saxophone grooves, over-the-top Gospel-style singing, moans, screams, and other emotive inflections, accompanied by a combination of boogie-woogie and rhythm and blues music. This new music, which included an original injection of funk into the rock and roll beat, inspired James Brown, Elvis Presley and generations of other rhythm &amp; blues, rock and soul music artists. He was subsequently among the seven initial inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 and was one of only four of these honorees (along with Ray Charles, James Brown, and Fats Domino) to also receive the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Lifetime Achievement Award.\nIn 1957, while at the height of stardom, he became a born-again Christian, enrolled in and attended Bible college, and withdrew from recording and performing secular music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e53a558e2f4713c95b7bae7a5d6e7fdd2275f16","amp;dn":"Heroes+Of+Rock+N+Roll+-+4+Cd+%281996%29+%5BLOSSLESS+FLAC%5D%5BTntvillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e53a558e2f4713c95b7bae7a5d6e7fdd2275f16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,83,165,88,226,244,113,60,149,183,186,231,165,214,231,253,210,39,95,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
