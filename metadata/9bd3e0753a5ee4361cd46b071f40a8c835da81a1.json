Why??'\nA: It's because you're missing certain codecs. There's 2 option to this ; \n   \n   OPTION 1: Download &amp; install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: \n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n   OPTION 2: Download &amp; install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you've downloaded\n\nQ: 'I download a keygen from a user &amp; my AV flagged it as a virus!'\nA: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. \n\n   First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.\n   \n   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user &amp; check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. \n\n   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.\n   IF YES, most probably it's false positive.\n\n   Well, if you're still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum &amp; report it here: \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt; ; the staff will gladly double-check it.                                                                    \n\nQ: 'I can no longer log into my account on TPB. Why is this so?'\nA: Most probably you're banned. Don't worry, drop by to the forum &amp; explain it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=3772\n\nQ: 'I registered an account on TPB, but i don't receive any of the confirmation/activation email.
