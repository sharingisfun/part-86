Singer Johnny Fontaine, Corleone's godson, asks for help in landing a movie role that will revitalize his flagging career. Hagen is dispatched to California to meet with studio head Jack Woltz. After initially refusing to cast Fontane, Woltz caves in when he finds the severed head of his prized racehorse in his bed the next morning.\n\nUpon Hagen's return, the family leadership meets with Virgil Sollozzo, who asks Don Corleone to protect the rival Tattaglia family's planned heroin business. Don Vito disapproves of drug trafficking and feels his political influence could be jeopardized; he rejects the potentially lucrative proposal. He then sends his primary enforcer, Luca Brasi, to infiltrate Sollozzo's organization, but Brasi is summarily executed.\n\nDon Corleone is shot in an assassination attempt. Sollozzo abducts Hagen and persuades him to offer Corleone's eldest son, Sonny (James Caan), the deal previously offered to the Don. The youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), whom the other Mafia families consider a &quot;civilian&quot; uninvolved in mob business, averts a second murder attempt at the hospital where his father is being treated, but is beaten by corrupt police Captain McCluskey. Sonny retaliates by having Bruno Tattaglia killed.\n\nWhen Sollozzo meets with Michael in an attempt to settle the dispute, Michael shoots and kills both Sollozzo and McCluskey. He takes refuge in Sicily, where he soon marries a young local woman named Apollonia. The third Corleone brother, Fredo, is sent to Las Vegas, to be sheltered by casino operators the Corleones have backed financially. Open warfare erupts between the Corleones and the other members of the Five Families, while the police and other authorities begin to clamp down on Mafia activity. Don Vito is particularly distressed when he learns of Michael's involvement, since he had planned for Michael to remain uninvolved in the &quot;family business.&quot;\n\nWhen Sonny impulsively leaves the guarded family compound to confront Connie's husband, Carlo (Gianni Russo), over his wife-beating, he is killed in an ambush, this after he assaulted Carlo the first time. Meanwhile, Michael narrowly escapes death in Sicily, when his wife is killed by a bomb in their car.\n\nDon Vito meets with the other Five Family dons and settles their dispute, withdrawing his opposition to the Tattalglia's heroin business. He deduces from the negotiations that the Tattaglias were acting on behalf of the more powerful Don Barzini. With his safety now guaranteed, Michael returns home. More than a year later, he marries his long time American girlfriend, Kay. As his father withdraws from active control of the Corleone family, and middle brother Fredo seen as incapable of shouldering the Don's responsibilities, Michael takes control of the family. He promises Kay he will legitimize its businesses within five years.\n\nBiding his time, Michael allows rival families to pressure Corleone enterprises and eat away at their revenues, disturbing several of his caporegimes. He directs them not to retaliate, disclosing plans to move family operations to Nevada while spinning off New York operations to family members who stay behind. Michael chooses Carlo to go to Vegas and replaces Hagen with a new consigliere; Vito explains to the upset Hagen that he and Michael have longer-range plans for him and for the family.\n\nMichael travels to Las Vegas, intending to buy out their casino partner, Moe Greene. Greene angrily rejects the proposal, deriding the Corleones as a failing organization. Michael is particularly angered when Fredo, under the sway of Greene and his associates, warns his brother that Greene is too important to be treated in that fashion.\n\nVito Corleone collapses and dies while playing with his young grandson Anthony in his tomato garden. At the burial, caporegime Tessio (Abe Vigoda) arranges a meeting between Michael and Don Barzini (Richard Conte), now seen as the dominant figure in the New York families. As Vito had warned Michael, Tessio's involvement signals his shift of allegiance to the Barzini family; the planned meeting is intended to result in Michael's execution. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie and Carlo's son, where Michael will stand as his godfather.\n\nAs the christening proceeds, Corleone assassins murder the dons heading the other New York families, as well as Moe Greene. After the christening, Tessio learns that Michael is aware of his betrayal, and is taken off to his death. Michael confronts Carlo over his suspected involvement in setting up Sonny's killing, promising him safety; after Carlo confesses, he is garotted at Michael's direction.\n\nLater that day, Connie accuses Michael of murdering the vanished Carlo as Kay watches. When Kay confronts him privately, he denies the accusation to her, an answer she appears to accept. As the film ends, Kay sees Michael receiving gestures of respect from other mafiosi, paralleling the treatment given his father, just before the door to his office is closed.\n===============================================================================\nCAST\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDon Vito Corleone \t\t(Marlon Brando)\nMichael Corleone\t\t(Al Pacino)\nSantino &quot;Sonny&quot; Corleone \t(James Caan)\nTom Hagen \t\t\t(Robert Duvall)\nKay Adams-Corleone \t\t(Diane Keaton)\nFredo Corleone \t\t\t(John Cazale)\nCostanzia &quot;Connie&quot; Corleone     (Talia Shire)\nPeter &quot;Fat&quot; Clemenza \t\t(Richard S.

One involves Mafia chief Michael Corleone in 1958/1959 after the events of the first movie; the other is a series of flashbacks following his father, Vito Corleone from 1917 to 1925, from his youth in Sicily (1901) to the founding of the Corleone family in New York.\n\nThe film begins in 1901, in the town of Corleone in Sicily, at the funeral of young Vito's father, Antonio Andolini, who has been murdered for an insult to the local Mafia lord, Don Ciccio. During the procession, Vito's older brother is murdered because he swore revenge on the Don. Vito's mother goes to Ciccio to beg for mercy, but he refuses, knowing that nine year old Vito will seek revenge later in life. The mother takes Ciccio hostage at knifepoint, allowing her son to escape, and Ciccio's men kill her. They search the town for the boy, but he is aided in his escape by the townspeople. Vito finds his way by ship to New York, and at Ellis Island an immigration agent chooses Vito's hometown of Corleone as his surname, and he is registered as &quot;Vito Corleone&quot;.\n\nIn the late 1950s, in a scene similar to the opening of the first film, Michael Corleone, Godfather of the Corleone family, deals with various business and family problems during an elaborate party at his Lake Tahoe, Nevada compound to celebrate his son's First Communion. He meets with Nevada Senator Pat Geary, who despises the Corleones, to discuss the price of the gaming licenses for the hotel/casinos the Family is buying.\n\nMichael deals with his sister Connie, who, although recently divorced, is planning to marry a man with no obvious means of support and of whom Michael disapproves. He also talks with Johnny Ola, the right hand man of Jewish gangster Hyman Roth, who is supporting Michael's move into the gambling industry. Belatedly, Michael deals with Frank &quot;Five Angels&quot; Pentangeli, who took over Corleone caporegime Peter Clemenza's territory after his death, and now has problems with the Rosato Brothers, who are backed by Roth. Pentangeli leaves abruptly, after telling Michael &quot;your father did business with Hyman Roth, your father respected Hyman Roth, but your father never trusted Hyman Roth.&quot;\n\nLater that night, an assassination attempt is made on Michael, which he survives when his wife Kay notices the bedroom window drapes are inexplicably open. Afterwards, Michael tells Tom Hagen that the hit was made with the help of someone close, and that he must leave, entrusting all his power to Hagen to protect his family.\n\nThe action then switches to 1917, where the adult Vito Corleone works in a New York grocery store with his friend Genco Abbandando. The neighborhood is controlled by a member of the &quot;The Black Hand,&quot; Don Fanucci, who extorts protection payments from local businesses. One night, Vito's neighbor Clemenza asks him to hide a stash of guns for him, and later, to repay the favor, takes him to a fancy apartment where they commit their first felony together, stealing an elegant rug.\n\nThe film flash-forwards to Michael's time. Michael meets with Hyman Roth in Florida and tells him that he believes Frank Pentangeli was responsible for the assassination attempt, and that Pentangeli will pay for it. Traveling to Brooklyn, Michael lets Pentangeli know that Roth was actually behind it, and that Michael has a plan to deal with Roth, but he needs Frankie to cooperate with the Rosato Brothers in order to put Roth off guard. When Pentangeli goes to meet with the Rosatos, he is told &quot;Michael Corleone says hello,&quot; as he is attacked from behind but the attempted murder is accidentally interrupted by a policeman. Pentangeli is left for dead, and his bodyguard, Willie Cicci, is struck by a car.\n\nIn Nevada, Tom Hagen is called to a brothel run by Michael's older brother Fredo, where Senator Geary is implicated in the death of a prostitute, and Tom offers to take care of the problem in return for &quot;friendship&quot; between the Senator and the Corleone family.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael meets Roth in Havana, Cuba, in late 1958, at the time when dictator Fulgencio Batista is soliciting American investment, and communist guerrillas are trying to bring down the government. At a birthday party for Roth, Michael mentions that there is a possibility that the rebels might win, making their business dealings in Cuba problematic. The comment prompts Roth to remark, privately, that Michael has not delivered the two million dollars to firm their partnership.\n\nFredo, carrying the promised money, arrives in Havana and meets Michael. Michael mentions Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola to him, but Fredo says he has never met them. Michael confides to his brother that it was Roth who tried to kill him, and that he plans to try again. Michael assures Fredo that he has already made his move, and that &quot;Hyman Roth will never see the New Year.&quot;\n\nInstead of turning over the money to Roth, Michael asks him who gave the order to have Frank Pentangeli killed. Roth avoids the question, instead speaking angrily of the murder of his old friend, Moe Greene, which Michael had orchestrated (as depicted at the end of the first film).\n\nMichael has asked Fredo, who knows Havana well, to show Senator Geary and other important officials and businessmen a good time, during which Fredo pretends to not recognize Johnny Ola. Soon after, at a sex show, Fredo comments loudly that Johnny Ola told him about the place, contradicting what he told Michael twice earlier, that he didn't know Roth or Ola. Michael now realizes that the traitor is his own brother, and dispatches his bodyguard to deal with Roth.\n\nJohnny Ola is strangled, but Roth, in a delicate state, is taken to a hospital, where Michael's enforcer is shot trying to kill him. At Batista's New Year's Eve party, at the stroke of midnight, Michael grasps Fredo tightly by the head and kisses him: &quot;I know it was you Fredo; you broke my heart.&quot; When guerillas attack, the guests flee, but Fredo refuses to go with Michael, despite Michael's pleas that Fredo is still his brother and that it's the only way out.\n\nMichael returns to his Lake Tahoe compound, where Hagen tells him that Roth escaped Cuba after suffering a stroke and is recovering in Miami, that Michael's bodyguard is dead, and that Fredo is probably hiding in New York. Hagen also informs Michael that Kay had a miscarriage while he was away.\n\nIn New York of 1917, Don Fanucci of the Black Hand is now aware of the partnership between Vito, Clemenza and Sal Tessio, and wants his share. Clemenza and Tessio agree to pay, but Vito is reluctant and asks his friends to leave everything in his hands so Fanucci will accept less and indeed, Vito manages to get Fanucci to take only one sixth of what he demanded (100 of 600 dollars). Immediately afterwards, during the neighborhood festa, Vito murders Fanucci. With Fanucci dead, Vito earns the respect of the neighborhood and begins to intercede in local disputes, operating out of the storefront of his Genco Pura Olive Oil Company (named after his friend Genco Abbandando).\n\nIn Washington, D.C., a Senate committee, of which Senator Geary is a member, is conducting an investigation into the Corleone family. They question disaffected &quot;soldier&quot; Willie Cicci, but he cannot implicate Michael, because he never received any direct orders from him. When Michael appears before the committee, Senator Geary makes a big show of supporting Italian-Americans and then excuses himself from the proceedings. Michael makes a statement challenging the committee to produce a witness to corroborate the charges against him. The hearing ends with the Chairman promising a witness who will do exactly that.\n\nFrank Pentangeli, who did not die in the attack by the Rosato Brothers, has made a deal with the FBI, and will testify against Michael. Tom Hagen and Michael discuss the problem, observing that Roth's strategy to destroy Michael is well planned. Michael's brother Fredo has been found and persuaded to return to Nevada, and in a private meeting he explains to Michael his betrayal: upset about being passed over to head the family in favor of Michael, he wants respect and his due. He helped Roth thinking there would be something in it for him, but he swears he didn't know they wanted to kill Michael. He also tells Michael that the Senate Committee's chief counsel is Roth's man. Michael then tells Fredo: &quot;You're nothing to me now. Not a brother, not a friend, nothing&quot;, and privately instructs Al Neri that nothing is to happen to Fredo while their mother is still alive.\n\nAt the hearing in which Pentangeli is to testify, Michael arrives accompanied by Pentangeli's brother, whose presence causes Frank to recant his previous statements about Michael. When Pentangeli is pressed, he claims that he just told the FBI what they wanted to hear. With no witness to testify against Michael the committee adjourns, with Hagen, acting as Michael's lawyer, loudly demanding an apology.\n\nAt a hotel room afterwards, Kay tries to leave Michael, taking their children with her. Michael at first tries to mollify her, but loses his temper and hits her violently when she reveals to him that her recent &quot;miscarriage&quot; was actually an abortion to avoid providing another child into Michael's criminal inheritance.\n\nWhile visiting Sicily, Vito is introduced to the elderly Don Ciccio as the man who imports their olive oil to America, and who wants his blessing. When Ciccio asks Vito who his father was, Vito says, &quot;My father's name is Antonio Andolini, and this is for you!&quot;, cutting the old man's stomach open with a knife, avenging the death of his father, mother, and brother.\n\nWhen Carmella Corleone, Vito's widow and the mother of his children, dies, the whole Corleone family is reunited. Michael is still shunning Fredo, who is miserable, but relents when Connie implores him to. Michael and Fredo embrace, but at the same time Michael signals to his capo that Fredo's protection from harm, in effect while their mother lived, has now run out.\n\nMichael, Tom Hagen, and Rocco Lampone discuss their final dealings with Hyman Roth, who has been unsuccessfully seeking asylum from various countries, and was even refused entry to Israel as a returned Jew. Michael rejects Hagen's advice that the Corleone family's position is secure, and killing Roth and the Rosato brothers for revenge is an unnecessary risk. Later, Hagen pays a visit to Frank Pentangeli on a military base and suggests that he take his own life, in the manner of unsuccesful ancient Roman conspirators who, in return, were promised that their families would be taken care of after their suicide.\n\nWith the connivance of Connie, Kay visits her children, but cannot bear to leave them and stays too long. When Michael arrives, he coldly closes the door in her face.\n\nThe Godfather Part II reaches its climax in a montage of assassinations and death, reminiscent of the end of The Godfather. As he arrives at an airport to be taken into custody, Hyman Roth is killed by Rocco Lampone disguised as a journalist, who is immediately shot dead in his turn. On the military base, Frank Pentangeli is found dead, having followed Hagen's instructions and committed suicide. Finally, Fredo is murdered by Al Neri while they are fishing on Lake Tahoe - while Fredo is saying a Hail Mary to help catch a fish.\n\nThe penultimate scene takes place in 1941, and the Corleone family is preparing a surprise birthday party for Vito. Sonny introduces Carlo Rizzi, Connie's future husband and betrayer of Sonny, to his family. They all talk about the recent attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese, and Michael shocks everybody by announcing that he has just enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. Sonny ridicules Michael's choice, and Tom Hagen mentions how his father has great expectations for Michael. Fredo is the only one who supports his brother's decision. Sal Tessio comes in with the cake for the party, and when Vito arrives, all but Michael leave to greet him.\n\nThe final scene in the film is Michael sitting by himself at Lake Tahoe, in silent contemplation. \n===============================================================================\nCAST\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichael Corleone \t\t(Al Pacino)\nTom Hagen \t\t\t(Robert Duvall)\nYoung Vito Corleone \t\t(Robert De Niro)\nKay Corleone \t\t\t(Diane Keaton)\nFredo Corleone \t\t\t(John Cazale)\nConnie Corleone \t\t(Talia Shire)\nHyman Roth\t\t\t(Lee Strasberg)\nFrankie Pentangeli\t\t(Michael V.

It completes the story of Michael Corleone, a Mafia kingpin who tries to legitimize his criminal empire. The movie also weaves into its plot a fictionalized account of real-life events ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the 1978 death of Pope John Paul I and the Papal banking scandal of 1981-1982 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and links them with each other and with the affairs of Michael Corleone. The film stars Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Andy GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a, and features Eli Wallach, Joe Mantegna, George Hamilton, Bridget Fonda, and Sofia Coppola.\n\nDespite being part of a popular movie series, Part III has received mixed reviews and receptions. However, Coppola and Puzo originally wanted the title of the film to be The Death of Michael Corleone. Paramount Pictures however would not accept that title. Coppola states that The Godfather series is in fact two films, and Part III is the epilogue. The film nevertheless grossed $136,766,062 and was nominated for seven Academy Awards.\n===============================================================================\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n===============================================================================\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFile Name : ..The Godfather (Parts 1-3)The Godfather Part III.MKV \nFile size : 2.17 GiB \nDuration : 2h 50mn \nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099674/\nOverall bit rate : 1823 Kbps \n===============================================================================\nVIDEO\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile : Simple@L1 \nFormat settings, BVOP : No \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No Warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263) \nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/ASP \nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Simple Profile \nWidth : 716 pixels \nHeight : 480 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9 \nFrame rate mode : Constant \nFrame rate : 23.976 fps \nResolution : 8 bits \nColorimetry : 4:2:0 \nScan type : Progressive \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.178 \nStream size : 1.74 GiB (80%) \nWriting library : Lavc52.0.0 \n===============================================================================\nAUDIO\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFormat : AC-3 \nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3 \nCodec ID : A_AC3 \nDuration : 2h 57mn \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 320 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 6 channels \nChannel positions : Front: L|C|R -  Surround: L|R - LFE \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nResolution : 16 bits \nStream size : 390 MiB (18%) \n===============================================================================\nPLOT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichael Corleone is nearing 60 and feeling tremendous guilt for his ruthless rise to power, especially for ordering the murder of his brother Fredo two decades before. By now, he has mostly retired from the Mafia, selling the Las Vegas casinos and leaving the Corleone family's criminal interests in the hands of former enforcer Joey Zasa. His adopted brother Tom Hagen is now dead and the Corleone compound at Lake Tahoe has been abandoned. Michael and Kay have been divorced since 1959, and Michael gave her custody of their children, Anthony and Mary. He has since returned to New York City, where he is using his tremendous wealth and power to restore his reputation via numerous acts of charity. In an attempt to break with the past, Michael creates a charity, the Vito Corleone Foundation, in memory of his father, which he has endowed with $100,000,000 to use for the betterment of Sicily.\n\nAt a ceremony in St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, presided over by Archbishop Gilday, Michael is named a Commander of the Order of St. Sebastian. At a lavish party following the ceremony, Michael and Kay have an uneasy reunion. Anthony tells his father that he is going to drop out of law school to pursue a career as an opera singer. Kay supports his choice, but Michael disagrees, wishing that his son would either finish law school or join the family business. Anthony steadfastly refuses, stating that while he loves his father, he will never be part of the family business. Michael eventually, though somewhat reluctantly, acquiesces to Anthony's wishes.\n\nMeanwhile, Vincent Mancini, the illegitimate son of Michael's brother Sonny, shows up at the party. He is embroiled in a feud with Zasa, who has involved the Corleone family in major drug trafficking and turned Little Italy into a slum. In Michael's study, Vincent and Zasa tell him about their feud, a discussion that erupts into a fight, in which Vincent bites off part of Zasa's ear. Zasa is escorted out and Michael scolds Vincent for losing his temper, but is nevertheless impressed by Vincent's passionate loyalty to him, ultimately agreeing to take Vincent under his wing.\n\nThat night, as Vincent has a one-night stand with Grace Hamilton, a journalist he met at the party, two men break in and try to kill him. Vincent quickly gains the upper hand, and kills one in order to frighten the other into revealing that Zasa is the man who sent them. Once the second assassin has surrendered, Vincent kills him, too. Meanwhile, Michael busies himself with the biggest deal of his career: he has recently bought up enough stock in Immobiliare, an international real estate holding company known as &quot;the world's biggest landlord&quot;, to control six of the company's 13-member board of directors. He now makes a tender offer to buy the Vatican's 25% interest in the company, which will give him majority control. Knowing that Archbishop Gilday, who serves as head of the Vatican Bank, has run up a massive deficit, he offers to pay $600,000,000 to the Bank in exchange for the shares.\n\nDon Altobello, an elderly New York Mafia boss and old friend of the Corleones (as well as Connie's godfather), soon visits Michael, telling him that his old partners on the Commission want in on the Immobiliare deal. A meeting is arranged at an Atlantic City hotel, and Michael appeases most of the Mafia bosses with generous payoffs from the sale of his Las Vegas holdings. Zasa, however, gets nothing, and furiously declares that Michael is his enemy and storms out. Altobello follows close behind, allegedly attempting to calm him down. Minutes later, a helicopter hovers outside the conference room and sprays it with submachine gun fire. Most of the other mob bosses are killed, but Michael, Vincent, and Michael's trusted bodyguard, Al Neri, escape. Back at his apartment in New York, Michael is told that those mob bosses who escaped the massacre quickly made deals with Zasa, and comes to the realization that Altobello supported Zasa in carrying out the hit. As Michael considers how to respond to the situation, he suffers a diabetic stroke and is hospitalized. In his delirium, Michael cries out Fredo's name shortly before he is loaded on an ambulance to the hospital.\n\nAs Michael recuperates in the hospital, Vincent begins a romantic relationship with Mary, despite being first cousins, and also plots revenge against Joey Zasa. During a street festival hosted by Zasa's Italian American civil rights group, Vincent's men gun down Zasa's bodyguards. Vincent, disguised as a mounted police officer, then murders Zasa himself. When Michael discovers this, he berates Vincent for his rashness. Michael also insists that Vincent end his relationship with Mary, because Vincent's involvement in the family's criminal dealings puts Mary's life in jeopardy. Vincent agrees.\n\nThe family takes a vacation to Sicily in March 1980, in preparation for Anthony's operatic debut in Palermo. They stay at the villa of Don Tommasino, the Mafia boss who sheltered Michael when he was on the run in the first film. Michael tells Vincent to speak with Altobello and falsely tell him that he is planning to leave the Corleone family. Altobello supports the idea of Vincent switching his allegiance, and introduces him to Don Licio Lucchesi, a powerful Italian political figure. Michael realizes that the Immobiliare deal was a conspiracy by Lucchesi, Archbishop Gilday, and Vatican accountant Frederick Keinszig to swindle him out of his money, and visits Cardinal Lamberto, the man favored to become the next Pope, to speak about the deal. Lamberto convinces Michael to make his first confession in 30 years, in which he tearfully admits to ordering Fredo's murder.\n\nShortly after the meeting between Vincent and Lucchesi, Altobello travels to the small village of Montelepre, where he meets Mosca, an elderly, veteran hitman with whom he has previously done business. Altobello hires Mosca and his son, Lupe, to assassinate Michael. A few days later, Mosca and Lupe, disguised as priests, make their move, attempting to hijack Don Tommasino and force him to allow them entry to his villa. Tommasino refuses, and Mosca kills him with a lupara. Touring Sicily with Kay, who has arrived for AnthonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s operatic debut, Michael asks for her forgiveness. As they both admit that they still love each other, Michael receives word that Tommasino is dead.\n\nAfter the death of Pope Paul VI, Cardinal Lamberto is elected Pope John Paul I, which means that the Immobiliare deal will likely be ratified, due to his intention to &quot;clean up&quot; the dealings of the Vatican. The new Pope's intentions come as a death knell to the plot against the ratification of the Immobiliare deal, prompting frantic attempts by the plotters to cover their own tracks. Vincent tells Michael that he has learned from Altobello of Mosca's plot on his life. Vincent wants to strike back, but Michael cautions him, saying that if he goes ahead with such a plan, there will be no turning back. Vincent insists on revenge, and Michael relents, making Vincent the new Don of the Corleone family. In exchange, Vincent agrees to put an end to his relationship with Mary.\n\nThe family travels to Palermo to see Anthony perform the lead in Pietro Mascagni's &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; at the renowned Teatro Massimo. Meanwhile, Vincent exacts his revenge: Interspersed with scenes from AnthonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance are the brutal murders of the enemies of the Corleone family:\n\nFrederick Keinszig is abducted by Vincent's men, who smother him with a pillow (first having a rosary dropped on his face) and hang him from a bridge to make his death look like an apparent suicide.\nDon Altobello, also attending the opera, eats a poisoned cannoli that his goddaughter Connie gives him. He soon dies a silent death as Connie watches from her box.\nAl Neri travels to the Vatican, where he shoots Archbishop Gilday as he climbs a spiral staircase and throws his corpse down the gap between the stairs.\nFinally, Calo (Tommasino's former bodyguard) meets with Don Lucchesi at his office, claiming to bear a message from Michael. After being thoroughly frisked for weapons, Calo stabs Lucchesi in the throat with Lucchesi's own glasses, killing him before being shot by Lucchesi's bodyguard.\n\nThe killings are too late to save the Pope, however. Even as Michael and Vincent's men wipe out the plotters, His Holiness drinks poisoned tea provided to him by Archbishop Gilday and soon dies in his bed.\n\nMosca, still disguised as a priest and armed with a sniper rifle, descends upon the opera house during Anthony's performance, killing three of Vincent's men and preparing to shoot his target from a box, but the opera ends before he has the chance to pull the trigger. The assassin retreats to the opera house faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade's staircase and tries to shoot Michael there. At the same moment, Mary is confronting her father about the forced break-up with Vincent. Mosca fires his handgun twice, wounding Michael and killing Mary. As Mosca is wrestled to the ground by a group of real priests, Vincent kills him with a single shot. As Kay weeps, Michael cradles Mary's bloody body in his arms and screams in agony.\n\nThe scene dissolves to a short montage of Michael's memories, the first being a dance with Mary, the second being a dance with his first wife Apollonia, and the last being a dance with Kay ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ symbolizing the women he has lost.\n\nThe film ends with Michael as an old man, seated alone in the front yard of his Sicilian villa. After slowly putting on a pair of sunglasses, he drops an orange from his hand. He slumps over in his chair, collapses to the ground, and dies, completely alone.\n===============================================================================\nCAST\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMichael Corleone \t\t(Al Pacino)\nVincent Mancini \t\t(Andy GarcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­a)\nKay Adams-Corleone \t\t(Diane Keaton)\nConnie Corleone \t\t(Talia Shire)\nMary Corleone \t\t\t(Sofia Coppola)\nDon Altobello \t\t\t(Eli Wallach)\nB.J.
