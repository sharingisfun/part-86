Upon completion of her education at the School of American Ballet, Carlton chose to pursue singing instead, performing in New York City bars and clubs while attending university. Three months after recording a demo with producer Peter Zizzo, she signed with A&amp;M Records. She began recording her album, which was initially unsuccessful until Ron Fair took over.\r\n\r\nHer debut single, &quot;A Thousand Miles&quot;, reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2002. Her debut album, Be Not Nobody, followed and received platinum certification in the United States. Her subsequent albums, Harmonium (2004) and Heroes &amp; Thieves (2007), failed to match the commercial success of the first. She produced a fourth album, Rabbits on the Run (2011), independently before sourcing for a record label to release it. Carlton released a holiday EP titled Hear the Bells in November 2012, and she is release her fifth studio album, Liberman .\r\n \r\n1. Take It Easy\r\n2. Willows\r\n3. House of Seven Swords\r\n4.
