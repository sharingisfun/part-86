Other applications attempt to load the entire file into memory (grinding your system to a halt).\r\n- TextPipe's unique restrictions control precisely where changes are made. Restrict to a range of lines or columns, to specific Tab or CSV fields, between HTML/XML tags, and inside custom ranges. Restrictions can be combined, for example, to columns 1-10 of lines matching a pattern. Restrictions are essential for extensive but controlled search and replace\r\n- TextPipe performs multiple operations simultaneously. Other applications offer only 1, up to 5, or require a slow multi-pass approach\r\n- If TextPipe's 100+ filters don't suit your needs, you can use industry standard VBScript/JScript to write your own. Other applications either don't offer this facility, or force you to learn a proprietary language\r\n- TextPipe is unique in offering the EasyPattern pattern matching language for those not familiar with text pattern matching (regular expressions). EasyPatterns are English-like and very easy to learn\r\n- TextPipe can be scheduled for non-interactive use, and can be controlled by an external program. Other applications provide only a mouse interface.\r\n\r\n*********\r\nTechnical\r\n*********\r\nVersion 9.7 â€“ May 29, 2014\r\nSystem requirements: Windows 8 and x64, Windows 7 and x64, Vista, Vista 64, 2012/2008/2003 Server, XP\r\nHomepage: http://www.datamystic.com/textpipe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c82b00893f7882a4c69cc171293dd18c3b00973","amp;dn":"TextPipe+Pro+9.7.3+%28Local+install+%2B+Portable%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c82b00893f7882a4c69cc171293dd18c3b00973","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,130,176,8,147,247,136,42,76,105,204,23,18,147,221,24,195,176,9,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
