Romero effectively hits the &quot;reset&quot; button on his \r\nhugely influential Dead series with this scaled-back look at the zombie \r\napocalypse as told from the perspective of a student film maker who sets \r\nout to shoot a low-budget fright film, but instead captures the breakdown \r\nof modern society at the decaying hands of flesh-eating ghouls. Jason Creed \r\n(Joshua Close) and his crew are shooting a mummy movie in the Pennsylvania \r\nwoods when media reports begin pouring in about the dead rising from their \r\ngraves to feast on the flesh of the living. While self-centred star Ridley \r\n(Phillip Riccio) beats a hasty retreat to his family's fortified mansion \r\nhalfway across the state, the remaining cast and crew are forced to fight \r\nfor their lives despite having no weapons to speak of, and only a wobbly \r\nrecreational vehicle in which to seek shelter. Immediately recognizing the \r\ngravity of the situation and outspokenly sceptical of the media, determined \r\ndirector Creed decides to use his own camera to capture the real story in \r\na documentary entitled &quot;The Death of Death.&quot; Now, as the group attempts to \r\nfight their way to safety, the sceptics will all watch as their greatest \r\nfears become reality, and the realists will attempt to process a nightmare \r\nthat modern science would pass off as impossible.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Michelle Morgan.\r\n=&gt;-Joshua Close.\r\n=&gt;-Shawn Roberts.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-George A Romero.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Zombies : Mystery : Horror.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2007.\r\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.20 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 795 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 35mn.\r\n=&gt;-Diary of the Dead 2007.....: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/diary-of-the-dead2007/\r\n=&gt;-Diary of the Dead 2007.....: http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/diary-of-the-dead-2008/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 16:9.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 720.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 678 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 218 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a160b6b2c83bad89e8f936a39aed5bfbbf22734","amp;dn":"Diary+Of+The+Dead+-+George+A+Romero+Horror+2007+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a160b6b2c83bad89e8f936a39aed5bfbbf22734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,22,11,107,44,131,186,216,158,143,147,106,57,174,213,191,187,242,39,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
