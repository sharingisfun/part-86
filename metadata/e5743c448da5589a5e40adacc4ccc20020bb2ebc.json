The  Empress\r\nmurder has left a realm in flames with many hungry rivals  ready to\r\nseize the throne by force.  The Duke  Ivan then  calls  together  a\r\nprestigious council of six trusted advisors to  restore  order  and\r\nend the conflict that set ablaze Ashans lands. Might &amp; Magic Heroes\r\nVII makes a triumphant  return bringing  you the  essence  of  turn\r\nbased strategy gaming.\r\n\r\n- Extract\r\n- Burn or mount the .iso\r\n- Run setup.exe and install\r\n- Copy crack from CODEX dir to installdir\r\n- Play\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\nWhile testing, we noticed that the x86 version of this game\r\nis broken at several places. E.g. the game crashes if you play\r\nthe campaign with Jorgen (black guy to the left) or if you load\r\ncertain maps in skirmish mode. We confirmed this happens on\r\nthe original game on uplay too, so this is not crack related.\r\nThe x64 version has been much more stable - so we recommend you\r\nplay that if you can until Ubisoft fixes their bugs.\r\n\r\nGeneral Notes:\r\n- Block the game's exe in your firewall to prevent the game from\r\ntrying to go online ..\r\n- If you install games to your systemdrive, it may be necessary\r\nto run this game with admin privileges instead","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5743c448da5589a5e40adacc4ccc20020bb2ebc","amp;dn":"Might.and.Magic.Heroes.VII-CODEX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5743c448da5589a5e40adacc4ccc20020bb2ebc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,116,60,68,141,165,88,154,94,64,173,172,196,204,194,0,32,187,46,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
