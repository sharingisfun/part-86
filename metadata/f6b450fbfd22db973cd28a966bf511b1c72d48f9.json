The Army had orders to escort the Sioux to the railroad for transport to Omaha, Nebraska. One day earlier, the Sioux had been cornered and agreed to turn themselves in at the Pine Ridge Agency in South Dakota. They were the very last of the Sioux to do so. They were met by the 7th Cavalry, who intended to disarm them and ensure their compliance.\nDuring the process of disarming the Sioux, a deaf tribesman named Black Coyote could not hear the order to give up his rifle and was reluctant to do so.  A scuffle over Black Coyote's rifle escalated into an all-out battle, with those few Sioux warriors who still had weapons shooting at the 7th Cavalry, and the 7th Cavalry opening fire indiscriminately from all sides, killing men, women, and children, as well as some of their own fellow troopers. The 7th Cavalry quickly suppressed the Sioux fire, and the surviving Sioux fled, but US cavalrymen pursued and killed many who were unarmed.\nBy the time it was over, about 146 men, women, and children of the Lakota Sioux had been killed. Twenty-five troopers also died, some believed to have been the victims of friendly fire as the shooting took place at point blank range in chaotic conditions.  Around 150 Lakota are believed to have fled the chaos, with an unknown number later dying from hypothermia. \nFollowing the Massacre that day, U.S. soldiers left the wounded Native Americans to die in a three day blizzard  They later hired civilians to remove the bodies and bury them in a mass grave. \nIt was said that some of the Americans stripped the corpses of their clothing and collected some of their personal items as mementos of the occasion. Following the burial, the Americans lined up and took their picture beside the mass grave and twenty medals of honor were later given to honor the U.S. soldiers who participated in the massacre.\nIn 1903, a monument was erected at the site of the mass grave by surviving relatives to honor the &quot;many innocent women and children who knew no wrong...&quot;  who were killed in the massacre. Today, some family members are still seeking compensation from the U.S. government as heirs of the victims but they have been unsuccessful in receiving any monetary settlement so far.\nThe incident is considered noteworthy by the United States Army as the engagement in military history in which the most Medals of Honor have been awarded in the history of the US Army.  The site has been designated a National Historic Landmark\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6b450fbfd22db973cd28a966bf511b1c72d48f9","amp;dn":"The+Wounded+Knee+Massacre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6b450fbfd22db973cd28a966bf511b1c72d48f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,180,80,251,253,34,219,151,60,210,138,150,107,245,17,177,199,45,72,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
