One day Kaththi (Raj Tarun) meets Parineethi in the colony and falls in love with her. But Somanath has already fixed Parineethiâ€™s marriage with Rahul (Praveen), who also follows his â€œqualityâ€ values. After Somanath comes to know about Parineethiâ€™s love life, he then and there refuses to accept their relation as he does not know him. Then he proposes that Kaththi may come to his house for next 30 days (with a bond), so that his family members can know his caliber.  In this time, knowingly Kaththi creates a lot of problems for Somanath at his own house hence differences araise between them. At the end of last day of the month before any decision can be made, things turn around and Kaththi get forced to break the deal. Anyway we have known, if two main lead characters fall in love in a commercial cinema, it will end in a happy note. But before that happy note there is a â€œTwist in the taleâ€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5e38849360bdfbe8d0f4bb92c931e98a938cac8","amp;dn":"Cinema+Chupista+Maava+%282015%29+TELUGU+FULL+MOVIE+-+CAMRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5e38849360bdfbe8d0f4bb92c931e98a938cac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,227,136,73,54,11,223,190,141,15,75,185,44,147,30,152,169,56,202,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
