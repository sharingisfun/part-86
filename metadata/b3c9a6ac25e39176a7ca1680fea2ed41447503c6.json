And it was in the Mid-Sixties, the era where &quot;Motown Sound&quot; and &quot;The British Invasion&quot; were dominating the airwaves. These Motown Divas are amongst the very first batch of singers who gave the standards trendy twists and fresh flavors.\n\nIn May of 1967, ABC aired a television special called &quot;Rodgers and Hart Today&quot; where Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes performed with Bobby Darin, Petula Clark and The Mamas and the Papas. And that inspired producer Berry Gordy to have the trio record an album of purely Rodgers and Hart standards. On the disc's Liner Notes, George Solomon writes: &quot;The Supremes Sing Rodgers and Hart&quot; was scheduled to be a double LP, however, when the album was trimmed to a single disc, 12 tunes went into the Motown vaults. Now for the first time, some of these tunes have been digitally remixed and remastered to become &quot;The Rodgers and Hart Collection.&quot; The original sessions were recorded on October of 1966 and January of 1967.\n\nIt's so nice listening to Diana Ross as the main vocalist supported by Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard for the background vocals as they deliver these gems from a brilliant pair of songwriters. This is one of the most notable tributes to the artistry of Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, who produced some of the loveliest music that is so enjoyable today as it was yesterday, and will continue to delight our ears for all the years to come.\n\nI love listening to this CD in its entirety most especially &quot;Falling In Love With Love&quot; where Diana Ross shares the spotlight with Mary Wilson as they sing this treasure of a song with a kind of arrangement that truly defines the Motown feel.[/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/54rB81Pom2.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Supremes, The - The Rodgers &amp; Hart Collection\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Supremes, The\nAlbum................: The Rodgers &amp; Hart Collection\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1987\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 243kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
