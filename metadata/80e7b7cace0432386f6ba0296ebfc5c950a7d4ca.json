Not only does Ionic come with numerous mobile-optimized UI components, but it is also built on top of AngularJS for powerful templating and easy two-way data binding.\n\nFirebase is a perfect complement to Ionic. While Ionic is a great tool for building the front-end, Firebase can power the back-end. With Firebase, we don't need to worry about provisioning servers or building REST APIsÃ¢â‚¬â€with a little bit of configuration, we can let Firebase do the work.\nIn this course, we're going to build a recipe app called &quot;Foodbook&quot;.
