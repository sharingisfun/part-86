Requires SetupS.\n\nDescription: The Longest Journey is a is a point-and-click third-person graphic adventure that takes place in the parallel universes of Arcadia, a world of magic, and Stark, a world of science and technology. You play the role of April Ryan, a struggling 18-year-old art student in the year 2209 living in Stark. She learns that the line between the two worlds is growing thin, causing chaos on both sides. April also learns that she is a Shifter, one who is capable of walking between these worlds, and that that what she thought were nightmares are real, and that she must save not just one, but two worlds and is then tasked with restoring the Balance between the dimensions before it is too late.\n\nThe Longest Journey is a huge game, spanning 13 chapters, plus a prologue and epilogue, spread out over 4 CDs. All the usual graphic adventure elements are present, including lots of fairly challenging inventory-based puzzles, pages of dialogue, and bunches of places to explore. To help keep track of things, the game includes a diary, where April records her thoughts about important events, and a conversation log that records the text of every conversation.\n\nThe game drew praise from critics for its enigmatic, complex storyline and high production values, but was criticized for some of its more obscure puzzles.\n\n(Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Longest_Journey)\n\nMD5: e03e208535a6b096c4def4b4add1edde\n______________________________________________________________________\n\n'Built on LT technology' ...
