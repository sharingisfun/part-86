Barbosa-Canovas (CRC, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 1566769299\r\n\r\nIn order to successfully produce food products with maximum quality, each stage of processing must be well-designed. Unit Operations in Food Engineering systematically presents the basic information necessary to design food processes and the equipment needed to carry them out. It covers the most common food engineering unit operations in detail, including guidance for carrying out specific design calculations. Initial chapters present transport phenomena basics for momentum, mass, and energy transfer in different unit operations. Later chapters present detailed unit operation descriptions based on fluid transport and heat and mass transfer. Every chapter concludes with a series of solved problems as examples of applied theory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b4c28c4986fa205eda78bee0df9d81e35a9d556","amp;dn":"Unit+Operations+in+Food+Engineering","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b4c28c4986fa205eda78bee0df9d81e35a9d556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,76,40,196,152,111,162,5,237,167,139,238,13,249,216,30,53,169,213,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
