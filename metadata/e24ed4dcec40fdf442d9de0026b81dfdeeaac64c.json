This is the Eastern Front.\n\nWar is fun to play in a game, but in reality, it is death. We should not forget that. Today, many people are spared by the horrors of war, but are suffering nonetheless. A lot of people wanted to donate money to our mod, and we decided to give it to a charity organisation. We think that the national multiple sclerosis society is a good choice. Multiple sclerosis is a painful disease that affects the nerve center, and there is no cure yet. If you think our mod is good and you want to donate, click on the link below and click donate on the upper right. We suggest a donation of 10 dollars, for a good cause.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e24ed4dcec40fdf442d9de0026b81dfdeeaac64c","amp;dn":"mod+Eeaster+Front","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e24ed4dcec40fdf442d9de0026b81dfdeeaac64c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,78,212,220,236,64,253,244,66,217,222,0,38,184,29,253,238,170,198,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
