Pink Floyd's influence on the members of Sentient Earth is most apparent. \n\nPurgatories Auguries is a thematic concept album about the end of life in all its incarnations. It was recorded over a couple of months in 2008 on budget-level equipment in Douglas, Ga. The album was never finished and Sentient Earth eventually broke up in utter defeat. \n\nInstead of letting time destroy all traces of the music, Sentient Earth member Dallas Suttles decided to release the &quot;most finished&quot; songs from those sessions in July 2013 to the web. As such, Purgatories Auguries 2013 is the final death knell of Sentient Earth as a band and a dream. \n\nSentient Earth's music is copyleft protected. Do what thou wilt. \nDescription provided by artist representative\ncredits released 28 July 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2fa26e564f5d5557730d427bac6ddaf1c47bec6","amp;dn":"Sentient+Earth+-+Purgatory+Auguries+%28Demo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2fa26e564f5d5557730d427bac6ddaf1c47bec6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,250,38,229,100,245,213,85,119,48,212,39,186,198,221,175,28,71,190,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
