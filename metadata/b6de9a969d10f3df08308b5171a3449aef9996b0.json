Like the sugar dogs, the cats in this book resemble real cats rather than fun cartoon characters, and this will be the bookâ€™s USP. A variety of cat types are included, such as a Burman, tabby, Siamese and endless variations of the â€˜moggyâ€™ â€” not to mention kittens, ginger toms, etc. â€” all in various poses (sleeping, playing, etc.) â€” and thereâ€™s even a tiny sugar mouse and some butterflies. As with her previous books, this book will include a section on the materials needed, and each project will show all the component parts of the finished cat, with instructions on how to construct it. This will be an ideal book for sugarcrafters wishing to create the perfect cake topper for their cat-loving friends and family.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author \nhttp://www.franklysweet.co.uk/images/frances2014.jpg\r\nFrances McNaughtonâ€™s sugarcraft books have become international bestsellers.
