Nodal uses a new method for creating and exploring musical patterns, probably unlike anything you've used before. You can play sounds using Nodal's built-in synthesiser or any MIDI compatible hardware or software instrument.\n\nNodal is based around the concept of a user-defined network. The network consists of nodes (musical events) and edges (connections between events). You interactively define the network, which is then automatically traversed by any number of virtual players. Players play their instruments according to the notes specified in each node. The time taken to travel from one node to another is based on the length of the edges that connect the nodes. Nodal allows you to create complex, changing sequences using just a few simple elements. Its unique visual representation allows you to edit and interact with the music generating system as the composition plays.\n\n\nNodal is compatible with DAW software such as Ableton Live, Logic Studio, Digital Performer and Garage Band. It can transmit and receive MIDI sync. You can edit a network using the mouse and keyboard, and optionally a MIDI keyboard. Nodal recognises and sends notes, sync, continuous controller and pitch bend information.\n\nFeatures\n\nsimple but powerful interface\nchange your composition while it is playing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ great for improvisation and quickly creating new musical ideas\ncompatible with any MIDI synthesiser and major Digital Audio software\ncan run stand alone using the built-in synthesiser\nlive performance tools: trigger complex sequences within the network using any MIDI keyboard or MIDI input device\ndefine your own interactive continuous controller curves (e.g. Volume, Pan, Modulation) for greater musical expression\nbuilt-in examples and tutorial information to get you started and making music quickly\n\n\n\nNodal 1.9 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ NEW!!\n\nNew Scales mode for Voice Groups allows you to set a key and mode for each player\nImproved debugging: show edge signalling information for each edge, last notes played for nodes\nVoice group muting: mute individual players while a composition is playing\nUpdated for current versions of MacOS and Windows\n\n\n\n[INSTALLATION]\n\n\n\n- Unrar with you favorite archiver, such as WinRar\n\n- Run Setup and Install\n\n- copy crack to install dir\n\n- Ok, It's Activated!\n[b]\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Thats it!
