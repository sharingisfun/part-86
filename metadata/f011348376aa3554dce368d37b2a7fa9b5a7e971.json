A group of male youths greet him in a large grassy area called the Glade that is enclosed by tall, stone walls. Every month, a new boy and supplies arrive in the elevator. The boys, who call themselves Gladers, have formed a rudimentary society with each assuming specialized tasks. Alby, their leader and the first to arrive in the Glade, says every boy eventually recalls his name, but none remember their past. The boy learns that a vast Maze surrounding the Glade may provide the only way out. During the day, designated Runners search the Maze for an escape route, returning before nightfall when the entrance closes. No one has ever survived a night inside the Maze.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Info\r\n\r\nCompression: No\r\nMovie Quality: DVD9\r\nSize: 7450Mb\r\nLanguages: English, French, German, Italian Ac3 5.1, Commentary by Wes Ball &amp; T.
