They have always had interest in Egyptian history and culture; thus they combined that interest with Death Metal. In 1994 they released their self-titled demo. A year later they released &quot;Festivals of Atonement&quot; as Cassette/CD and also performed a few live shows with bands such as Obituary, Deicide, and Six Feet Under. \r\n\r\n[b]Nile â€Žâ€“ In Their Darkened Shrines\r\nGenre:[/b] Rock\r\n[b]Style:[/b] Death Metal\r\n[b]Year:[/b] 2002\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/m2aIEij.png\r\n\r\nExact Audio Copy V1.1 from 23.
