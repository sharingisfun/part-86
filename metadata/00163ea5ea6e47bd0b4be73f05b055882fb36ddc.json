Violent, drunken, callous, vulgar, sarcastic, bloody minded - on a good day. His philosophy: everyone is guilty.\r\nClappers Wreake - the town that took the &quot;Great&quot; out of Britain - is a festering, pus-ridden ulcer on the underbelly of society. It's where murder is just one shot in a toxic cocktail of crime and the answers are written in blood. Sometimes pee... but mostly blood.\r\nWhen a hostage crisis erupts in the centre of Clappers Wreake, Hector has to make a choice: carry out a terrorist's demands, or let innocent hostages die. Hector's still on the fence.\r\nAll 3 episodes available now, get the full season!\r\nEpisode 1 â€“ We Negotiate with Terrorists:\r\nWhen a hostage crisis erupts in the centre of Clappers Wreake, Hector has to make a choice: carry out a terroristâ€™s demands, or let innocent hostages die.
