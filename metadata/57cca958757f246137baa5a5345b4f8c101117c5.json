But when a 21-year-old white man walks into a church in Charleston, South Carolina, and massacres nine black worshippers saying he wants to start a race war, the danger of the white supremacist ideology becomes a terrifying reality.\r\n\r\nThe film follows events as protests erupt and Black Power groups, including the New Black Panthers, take to the streets to preach their own agenda of black supremacy. And when the Ku Klux Klan and the New Black Panthers organise rival protests in the South Carolina capital, the two extreme visions of America violently come face to face","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57cca958757f246137baa5a5345b4f8c101117c5","amp;dn":"KKK+The+Fight+for+White+Supremacy+Documentary+EN+SUB+%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57cca958757f246137baa5a5345b4f8c101117c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,204,169,88,117,127,36,97,55,186,165,165,52,91,79,140,16,17,23,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
