Young (Wiley, 2010).pdf\n\nISBN 978-0-470-53967-5\n\nA technical and economic review of emerging waste disposal technologiesIntended for a wide audience ranging from engineers and academics to decision-makers in both the public and private sectors, &quot;Municipal Solid Waste to Energy Conversion Processes: Economic, Technical, and Renewable Comparisons&quot; reviews the current state of the solid waste disposal industry. It details how the proven plasma gasification technology can be used to manage Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) and to generate energy and revenues for local communities in an environmentally safe manner with essentially no wastes.\n\nBeginning with an introduction to pyrolysis/gasification and combustion technologies, the book provides many case studies on various waste-to-energy (WTE) technologies and creates an economic and technical baseline from which all current and emerging WTE technologies could be compared and evaluated.\n\nTopics include:\n\nPyrolysis/gasification technology, the most suitable and economically viable approach for the management of wastes\n\nCombustion technology\n\nOther renewable energy resources including wind and hydroelectric energy\n\nPlasma economics\n\nCash flows as a revenue source for waste solids-to-energy management\n\nPlant operations, with an independent case study of Eco-Valley plant in Utashinai, Japan\n\nExtensive case studies of garbage to liquid fuels, wastes to electricity, and wastes to power ethanol plants illustrate how currently generated MSW and past wastes in landfills can be processed with proven plasma gasification technology to eliminate air and water pollution from landfills","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d229d73ac62ffeecabc56bdded71d47d20bca1cb","amp;dn":"Municipal+Solid+Waste+to+Energy+Conversion+Processes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d229d73ac62ffeecabc56bdded71d47d20bca1cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,41,215,58,198,47,254,236,171,197,107,221,237,113,212,125,32,188,161,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
