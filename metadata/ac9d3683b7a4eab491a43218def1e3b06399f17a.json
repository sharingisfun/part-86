The decision to draft in Martin Noble (British Sea Power) and Graham Sutton (Bark Psychosis) to assist in engineering and mixing duties has paid off hand- somely in this atmospheric collection of 13 songs which are influenced by the duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love of a range of classic Ã¢â‚¬â„¢60s music, as well as drawing on elements of folk noir and post-industrial alt/indie to create a unique and contemporary-sounding fusion.\nThe uptempo The Third Light opens the proceedings with a flourish. Wearing a look of determination and a wry smile on its unshaven face, it could almost be an outtake from a lost Sergio Leone film. Rattling drums and an impatient walking bass, punctuated by reverbed electric guitar, nevertheless allow MarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smoothly keening vocals plenty of space while AlisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sweet multitracked harmonies and edgy viola add dramatic timbres.\nRating 9/10\n\nimage\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n01.
