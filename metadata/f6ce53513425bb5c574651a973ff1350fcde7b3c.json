Stossel is an American consumer reporter, investigative journalist, author, libertarian columnist, and former co-anchor for the ABC News show 20/20. In this show he looks at consumer-focused topics, such as civil liberties, the business of health care, and free trade\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nLAW &amp; BORDER\r\n\r\nFriday at 8PM ET on Fox Business\r\n\r\nWhy do borders matter? Here's our show:\r\n\r\nEUROPE'S REFUGEES: What will Europe do about the thousands of Syrian refugees? Did America cause the crisis by going into Iraq?\r\n\r\nBORDER WARS: Most presidential candidates say &quot;seal the border!&quot; What's possible? Who is right?\r\n\r\nSTATE BORDER: We assume there's something natural about borders between countries and states, but some division are insane. Part of Idaho is in Montana because a legislator got drunk. Part of Kentucky is in Tennessee because iron ore confused surveyors' compasses. Utah was made smaller because the U.S government hated polygamy.\r\n\r\nSTATES' RIGHTS: States are often called &quot;laboratories of democracy&quot; because they allow experiments. States are doing that now with issues like marijuana and school choice. With gay marriage, however, The Supreme Court said that states must be told what to do.\r\n\r\nOPEN BORDERS?: Jeffrey Tucker of Laissez Faire Books argues that we should have NO border controls. That was the law in America until the Immigration Act of 1882 banned &quot;idiots, lunatics, convicts and persons likely to become a public charge.&quot; Stossel and Tucker debate.\r\n\r\nMY TAKE: The border would be easier to secure if America were not also fighting a drug war. The War on Drugs has destroyed entire parts of Latin America and provided funds to the smugglers who sneak people North. If there were a clear benefit to the drug war, you might say it was worth it. Instead, it yields death, dislocation of populations, and funds murderous cartels that dig tunnels beneath our border walls.\r\n\r\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.09.18.Law.and.Border.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\r\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\r\nCodec ID                                 : isom\r\nFile size                                : 247 MiB\r\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\r\nOverall bit rate                         : 839 Kbps\r\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                                       : 1\r\nFormat                                   : AVC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile                           :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration                                 : 41mn 5s\r\nBit rate                                 : 700 Kbps\r\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 352 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\r\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\r\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\r\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\r\nColor space                              : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\r\nScan type                                : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.106\r\nStream size                              : 206 MiB (83%)\r\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\r\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=700 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                                       : 2\r\nFormat                                   : AAC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile                           : LC\r\nCodec ID                                 : 40\r\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\r\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\r\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\r\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (15%)\r\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6ce53513425bb5c574651a973ff1350fcde7b3c","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.09.18.Law.and.Border.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6ce53513425bb5c574651a973ff1350fcde7b3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,206,83,81,52,37,187,92,87,70,81,169,115,255,19,80,252,222,123,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
