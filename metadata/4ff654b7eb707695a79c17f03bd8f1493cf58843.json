I was up front to the right.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecording 'Proof' Comments:\r\n\r\nOn track 03, &quot;1000hp&quot; at 4:03-4:06, Sully Erna says, &quot;Well what's up Jacksonville, motherfuckin' Florida?!&quot;. The rest of the recording has other mentions as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Please feel free to convert/chop/edit/share however you like.
