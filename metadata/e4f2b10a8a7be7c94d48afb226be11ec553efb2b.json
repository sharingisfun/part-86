The band was based in the Richmond area of London, which at the time &quot;was kind of a hotbed for blues ( the Crawdaddy Club), especially acoustic style blues.&quot; Shortly thereafter, however, Denis became disenchanted with the music business. Thankfully he left us these recordings as an artefact. They shortened their name to Panama Ltd. for a second album by which time Liz Hann, their vocalist, had left and been replaced by Anne Matthews. On this better second album their early jugband sound is replaced by a brand of Beefheart - influenced rock.\n\n01 - Moonshine - 6.07\n02 - Set Me Free - 3.58\n03 - Citadel Chapters - 3.28\n04 - Woman I Love - 2.41\n05 - Dangle Wild - 4.32\n06 - Eastern Man - 3.29\n07 - Indian Summer - 3.13\n08 - Future - 4.07\n09 - Darkness Brings - 3.52\n10 - Laughing - 4.35\n\nmp3   256kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4f2b10a8a7be7c94d48afb226be11ec553efb2b","amp;dn":"Panama+Limited+Jug+Band+-+Indian+Summer+%281970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4f2b10a8a7be7c94d48afb226be11ec553efb2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,242,177,10,138,123,231,201,77,72,175,178,38,190,17,236,85,62,251,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
