Mia's dad Denny (Joshua Leonard) is a teacher and as a result of the snow day does not have to go to work. Mia's mom Kat (Mireille Enos), a travel agent, decides to call in sick and along with her family visit Mia's grandparents who live on a farm. It is also revealed that Mia is dating an older, popular up-and-coming rock-star named Adam Wilde (Jamie Blackley).\n\nThe story flashes back to Mia's early life with a rocker dad and an inexperienced mom; one day they take Mia to a music class where Mia decides that she wants to start playing the cello. After her parents see that Mia is passionate about the cello they hire a teacher to help her play. Kat is shown pregnant with Teddy (Jakob Davies) whom Mia thinks is the reason for her father's departure from his band.\n\nYears later, an adolescent Mia is still passionate about the cello and is playing at school in the band room where Adam peeks in on her playing, seeing her for the first time, leading him to ask Kim (Liana Liberato), Mia's best friend, about her. Adam then asks Mia out on a date to a cello recital, where they show mutual affection towards one another.\n\nThe story flashes back to current time with the family driving to the grandparents' farm when their car collides with an oncoming truck. Mia appears to have an out-of-body experience and sees her body lying on the road while paramedics are trying to help her and her family. Mia tries to ask a paramedic what is happening, but realizes that no one can see or hear her. Mia, now in the hospital, panics as she does not know the current status of any of her family members when they take her in for surgery. A sympathetic nurse (Aisha Hinds) tells Mia that it is up to her whether or not she wants to stay.\n\nThe story flashes back once again to Mia attending one of Adam's concerts with his band Willamette Stone, where she doesn't seem to fit in. Adam's band is steadily gaining more recognition and gets signed to a label, which starts to put a strain on their relationship due to the travel schedule. While at dinner, Mia's Grandpa suggests that she should apply to Juilliard, an idea which she initially rebuffs, but later further researches. She eventually lands an audition in San Francisco. It takes a while for Mia to tell Adam about her audition and when she does he becomes upset and leaves for a week-long gig.\n\nIn the present day, Mia undergoes surgery. She sees a doctor speaking with her grandparents who are standing outside of a pediatric room where Teddy lies in a coma-like state. Adam comes to the hospital to see Mia, but is not allowed in as he is not an immediate family member. It is then revealed that Mia's mom Kat was pronounced dead on arrival, and her dad Denny died on the operating table. She later finds out that Teddy has died from an epidural hematoma. Grandpa talks to Mia, revealing that her father gave up being in a band because he wanted to give her a better life and be a better father. He also, tearfully, gives Mia permission to move on from this life if she wants, which influences Mia to decide that she wants to die so that she can join her family on the other side.\n\nThe story flashes back to Mia at her audition for Juilliard, where she plays the best she has ever played, leading her to think that if accepted she will go. After a reconciliation with Adam, they talk about the huge possibility of her going to Juilliard, which ultimately leads to them breaking up and going their separate ways.\n\nAfter some time, Mia seems stable enough to receive more visitors. Mia is shown symbolically about to let go when she hears the music performed at the cello recital that she attended with Adam. It is revealed that Adam has come to see Mia and that he is playing his iPod for her. He brings with him a letter Mia has received from Juilliard saying that she has been accepted, and lets her know that he will do whatever she wants if she stays. He begins to play the song he has finally written about her. Mia, after flashing back through all the happy moments in her life, opens her eyes and sees Adam as he hovers over her and says,&quot;Mia?&quot;\n\n\nGeneral Info\n\nCompression: No\nMovie Quality: DVD9\nSize: 7490\nMb\nLanguages: English, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian Ac3 5.1, Commentary by R.
