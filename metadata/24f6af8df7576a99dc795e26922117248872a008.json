Instead, it asks you to imagine a much more fun future story and then takes it from there.  \r\n\r\nWhere this edit starts: if you imagine you just watched a rollicking 100 minute adventure of Doc and Marty in the future (it got kind of hairy clearly because now Doc wants to destroy the Time Machine) this takes that story as given, picks up for the final few sequences of BTTF2, rolls credits and then goes into BTTF3.\r\n\r\nThere are a bunch of edits across part 2 and 3 that have bothered me since I watched it in the theatre many years ago (you have all probably heard me rant about them over the years and now they are gone). I did the edit in Windows Movie Maker â€“ if that isnâ€™t the mark of the future I donâ€™t know what is. \r\n\r\nBoth films come in at a brisk 2 hours 49 minutes combined.  \r\n\r\nPhew","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24f6af8df7576a99dc795e26922117248872a008","amp;dn":"BTTF+2+and+3+Edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24f6af8df7576a99dc795e26922117248872a008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,246,175,141,247,87,106,153,220,121,94,38,146,33,23,36,136,114,160,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
