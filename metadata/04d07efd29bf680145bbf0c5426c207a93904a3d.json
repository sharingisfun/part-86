Ex-constable Claire Church never stopped running from her past. When bodies are unearthed, she is pulled back into an old investigation.\r\n\r\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/10/06/5ab082b241ff7638f93a6f64e9df8334.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\nEx-constable Claire Church has fled her dark past by escaping to the remote Western Isles with her partner, Norrie. But no matter how far she runs, she canâ€™t escape the shadows cast by her history.\r\n\r\nAs decades-old bodies are unearthed on a Manchester building site, the darkness threatens to fracture Claireâ€™s life once more.\r\n\r\nDCI John Hind immediately suspects the bodies are connected to a case that dates back to 1998: women who were reported missing, but few cared about - apart from his former protÃ©gÃ©, Claire. Harassed by his own impending misconduct investigation, Hind realises thereâ€™s only one option available - he must reconnect with Claire.\r\n\r\nJohnâ€™s reappearance rocks Claire, threatening the idyllic, yet fragile, life sheâ€™s built with her family. Desperate, John appeals to Claireâ€™s conscience and sense of guilt to help him catch the killer. But is John there to win justice, or Claire?\r\n\r\nTorn between her desire to help those women she believed she failed all those years ago and a fear of the darkness that once engulfed her, Claire must choose a path. All she really wants is peace, but with the past bleeding irreversibly into the present, Claire canâ€™t hide any longer - especially when a new body is discovered, carrying a message for her future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04d07efd29bf680145bbf0c5426c207a93904a3d","amp;dn":"From.Darkness.s01e01.EN.SUB.x265.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04d07efd29bf680145bbf0c5426c207a93904a3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,208,126,253,41,191,104,1,69,187,240,197,66,108,32,122,147,144,74,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
