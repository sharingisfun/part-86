This book provides an account of the life of LTTE chief Prabhakaran, who led an armed struggle against the Sri Lankan state to create Eelam, a separate nation for the Sri Lankan Tamils.\r\n\r\nThe book begins from Prabhakaranâ€™s childhood days in the aftermath of Indiaâ€™s and Sri Lankaâ€™s independence from Britain. The Sri Lankan Tamils were following Gandhiâ€™s non-violent methods to fight for their rights as citizens of Sri Lanka. Prabhakaran, an ardent fan of Bhagat Singh and Subhash Chandra Bose, felt that non-violence would not work against a Sinhala dominated government and began experimenting with violent acts against the Government to send a message. His initial success became the nucleus for the formation of LTTE, which became the quintessential guerrilla organization fighting the State","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1df61e39e17fbc2e12cec9005527055b23a69847","amp;dn":"Prabhakaran%3A+The+Story+of+his+struggle+for+Eelam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1df61e39e17fbc2e12cec9005527055b23a69847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,246,30,57,225,127,188,46,18,206,201,0,85,39,5,91,35,166,152,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
