After an endless line of &quot;dudes that just wanted to hang out and jam to the same old metal classics&quot; Brent started to lose hope...until his classified ad was answered by brothers, Dan and Matt. \r\nThe brothers were looking for something more exciting than their &quot;Nickleback does Kraftwerk&quot; cover project (it was not doing as well as expected).
