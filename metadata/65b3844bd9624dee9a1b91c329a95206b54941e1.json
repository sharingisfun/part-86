But instead of hiding herself in the shadows of thinner women, Brittany became a wildly popular blogger and national spokesmodelÃ¢â‚¬â€known for stripping on stage at TedX and standing in Times Square in a bikini on national television, and making skinny people everywhere uncomfortable.\n\nTalking honestly about size and body image on her popular blog, brittanyherself.com, she has ignited a national conversation. Now in her first book, she shares hilarious and painfully true stories about her life as a weird overweight girl growing up in rural Ohio, struggling with dating and relationships, giving the middle finger to dieting, finding love with a man smaller than her, accidentally having three kids, and figuring out the secret to loving her curves and becoming a nationally recognized body image advocate. And thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sex, lots of it!\n\nFat Girl Walking isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a diet book. It isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t one of those former fat people memoirs about how someone battled, and won, in the fight against fat. Brittany doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lose all the weight and reveal the happy, skinny girl thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been hiding inside her. Instead, she reminds us that being chubby doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll end up alone, unhappy, or the subject of a cable medical show. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important is learning to love your shape. With her infectious humor and soul-baring honesty, Fat Girl Walking reveals a life full of the same heartbreak, joy, oddity, awkwardness, and wonder as anyone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s.
