Cast the First Stone\n\n\nIn a few weeks, metal overlords Slayer will release their new album Repentless, their first album since 2011Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s very good World Painted Blood and their first since the 2011 death of longtime guitarist Jeff Hanneman. The band shared first single Ã¢â‚¬Å“When The Stillness ComesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ way back in April, and now theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve dropped Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cast The First StoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as part of this summers Adult Swim Singles series. The new song isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the classic thrash that we think of when we think of Slayer. Instead, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a deeper trudge Ã¢â‚¬â€ still fast, but not explode-your-brain fast. The riffs have room to breathe, but Slayer still bring all the force and authority youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect.
