Not one, not two, but three\r\n     Rufuses cause all kinds of crazy mayhem in the long-awaited adventure\r\n     comedy Goodbye Deponia: The Organon plans the destruction of Deponia,\r\n     the lovely Goal has (once again) disappeared, and anti-hero Rufus just\r\n     can't seem to stop getting in his own way.\r\n     All inventor and free spirit Rufus wanted to do was to get off the\r\n     junkyard planet of Deponia and move to Elysium, the paradise orbiting\r\n     Deponia as a spaceship reserved for the highest echelons of society.\r\n     Goal, the ex-Elysian girl that Rufus has fallen head over heels for,\r\n     still seems to be the key to his endeavor and to the elevator that will\r\n     get him to space. Finally, Rufus has come up with a seemingly perfect\r\n     plan. And yet, everything that could possibly go wrong suddenly does go\r\n     wrong. Rufus finds himself (initially in disguise) on a highway cruiser\r\n     amongst stern-faced officials of the Organon, while Goal goes missing.\r\n     When Rufus stumbles upon a cloning machine, he believes to have found\r\n     his way out. A clone copy is supposed to help him out of his predicament.\r\n     But an 'inexplicable' error causes complications and Goal slips from our\r\n     hero's reach once again. Now, he has to solve three major problems: He\r\n     needs to find Goal again, reach Elysium and prevent the destruction of\r\n     the entire planet of Deponia by the hand of the Organon.                                                       \r\n                                                                                 \r\n     Instructions:                                                               \r\n                                                                                 \r\n     -Burn or mount the image\r\n     -Install the game\r\n     -Enjoy\r\n                                                                                 \r\n     Note:                                                                       \r\n                                                                                 \r\n     Languages: English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish, Russian","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbf076047248871e7d1091a1376939a61e6f6c3f","amp;dn":"Goodbye.Deponia.MULTI7-CPY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbf076047248871e7d1091a1376939a61e6f6c3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,240,118,4,114,72,135,30,125,16,145,161,55,105,57,166,30,111,108,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
