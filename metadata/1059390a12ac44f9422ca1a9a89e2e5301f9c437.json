This is the\r\nonly difference between v3 and v4.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThis pack allows you to use all the encoder presets bundled with foobar2000.\r\n\r\nExtract all the files and folders in &quot;Tools.zip&quot; to a folder of your choice.\r\nIn my case, I created a &quot;tools&quot; folder directly below the foobar2000 program folder.\r\nThe first time you encode a file, foobar2000 will prompt you for the location of the\r\ncommand line encoder. Just point to the folder where the extracted files reside.\r\n\r\nNote that, to use AAC (Apple) or ALAC you DON'T need to install iTunes or QuickTime.\r\nAll necessary files are provided. Similarly, you DON'T need to install Winamp in\r\norder to use AAC (Winamp FhG).\r\n\r\nAlso included is the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Package (vcredist_x86.exe).\r\nThis is needed for AAC (Winamp FhG) encoder. if your system already has it,\r\nyou don't need to install it. If you're not sure, try to encode using AAC FhG. If\r\nyou get an error message, you probably need to install the VC2008 libraries.\r\n\r\nYou don't need any other files other than the ones provided here.\r\n\r\nThis pack works on both x86 and x64 systems.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe following encoders are provided:\r\n\r\nAAC (Apple) - qaac 2.55\r\nAAC (FDK) - fdkaac 0.6.2\r\nAAC (Nero) - Nero AAC Encoder 1.5.4.0\r\nAAC (Winamp FhG) - fhgaacenc 20150501\r\nApple Lossless - qaac 2.55 / refalac 1.55\r\nFLAC - flac 1.3.1\r\nMP3 (LAME) - LAME 3.99.5\r\nMusepack - MPC Encoder 1.30.0\r\nOgg Vorbis - OggEnc 2.88\r\nOpus - opusenc 0.1.9\r\nWavPack - WAVPACK 4.75.2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1059390a12ac44f9422ca1a9a89e2e5301f9c437","amp;dn":"foobar2000+Complete+Encoder+Pack+v4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1059390a12ac44f9422ca1a9a89e2e5301f9c437","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,89,57,10,18,172,68,249,66,44,161,169,168,158,46,83,1,249,196,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
